  abstract = {In this work, we develop a novel gait phase detection algorithm based on a hidden Markov model, which uses data from foot-mounted single-axis gyroscopes as input. We explore whether the proposed gait detection algorithm can generate equivalent results as a reference signal provided by force sensitive resistors (FSRs) for typically developing children (TD) and children with hemiplegia (HC). We find that the algorithm faithfully reproduces reference results in terms of high values of sensitivity and specificity with respect to FSR signals. In addition, the algorithm distinguishes between TD and HC and is able to assess the level of gait ability in patients. Finally, we show that the algorithm can be adapted to enable real-time processing with high accuracy. Due to the small, inexpensive nature of gyroscopes utilized in this study and the ease of implementation of the developed algorithm, this work finds application in the on-going development of active orthoses designed for therapy and locomotion in children with gait pathologies.},

  abstract = {An automated gait classification method is developed in this study, which can be applied to analysis and to classify pathological gait patterns using 3D ground reaction force (GRFs) data. The study involved the discrimination of gait patterns of healthy, cerebral palsy (CP) and multiple sclerosis subjects. The acquired 3D GRFs data were categorized into three groups. Two different algorithms were used to extract the gait features; the GRFs parameters and the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), respectively. Nearest neighbor classifier (NNC) and artificial neural networks (ANN) were also investigated for the classification of gait features in this study. Furthermore, different feature sets were formed using a combination of the 3D GRFs components (mediolateral, anterioposterior, and vertical) and their various impacts on the acquired results were evaluated. The best leave-one-out (LOO) classification accuracy 85\% was achieved. The results showed some improvement through the application of a features selection algorithm based on M-shaped value of vertical force and the statistical test ANOVA of mediolateral and anterioposterior forces. The optimal feature set of six features enhanced the accuracy to 95\%. This work can provide an automated gait classification tool that may be useful to the clinician in the diagnosis and identification of pathological gait impairments.},

  abstract = {In this study we describe an ambulatory system for estimation of spatio-temporal parameters during long periods of walking. This original method based on wavelet analysis is proposed to compute the values of temporal gait parameters from the angular velocity of lower limbs. Based on a mechanical model, the medio-lateral rotation of the lower limbs during stance and swing, the stride length and velocity are estimated by integration of the angular velocity. Measurement's accuracy was assessed using as a criterion standard the information provided by foot pressure sensors. To assess the accuracy of the method on a broad range of performance for each gait parameter, we gathered data from young and elderly subjects. No significant error was observed for toe-off detection, while a slight systematic delay (10 ms on average) existed between heelstrike obtained from gyroscopes and footswitch. There was no significant difference between actual spatial parameters (stride length and velocity) and their estimated values. Errors for velocity and stride length estimations were 0.06 m/s and 0.07 m, respectively. This system is light, portable, inexpensive and does not provoke any discomfort to subjects. It can be carried for long periods of time, thus providing new longitudinal information such as stride-tostride variability of gait. Several clinical applications can be proposed such as outcome evaluation after total knee or hip replacement, external prosthesis adjustment for amputees, monitoring of rehabilitation progress, gait analysis in neurological diseases, and fall risk estimation in elderly. r 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}In the last few years, estimating ground reaction forces by means of wearable sensors has come to be a challenging research topic paving the way to kinetic analysis and sport performance testing outside of labs. One possible approach involves estimating the ground reaction forces from kinematic data obtained by inertial measurement units (IMUs) worn by the subject. As estimating kinetic quantities from kinematic data is not an easy task, several models and protocols have been developed over the years. Non-wearable sensors, such as optoelectronic systems along with force platforms, remain the most accurate systems to record motion. In this review, we identified, selected and categorized the methodologies for estimating the ground reaction forces from IMUs as proposed across the years. Scopus, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed databases were interrogated on the topic of Ground Reaction Forces estimation based on kinematic data obtained by IMUs. The identified papers were classified according to the methodology proposed: (i) methods based on direct modelling; (ii) methods based on machine learning. The methods based on direct modelling were further classified according to the task studied (walking, running, jumping, etc.). Finally, we comparatively examined the methods in order to identify the most reliable approaches for the implementation of a ground reaction force estimator based on IMU data.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Objectives. To determine the relative contribution of variables from 3 biomechanical constructs to poststroke long-distance walking function and identify the biomechanical changes underlying posttraining improvements in long-distance walking function. Methods. Forty-four individuals {$>$}6 months after stroke participated in this study. A subset of these subjects (n = 31) underwent 12 weeks of high-intensity locomotor training. Cross-sectional (pretraining) and longitudinal (posttraining change) regression quantified the relationships between poststroke long-distance walking function, as measured via the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), and walking biomechanics. Biomechanical variables were organized into stance phase (paretic propulsion and trailing limb angle), swing phase (paretic ankle dorsiflexion and knee flexion), and symmetry (step length and swing time) constructs. Results. Pretraining, all variables correlated with 6MWT distance (rs = .39 to .75, Ps {$<$} .05); however, only propulsion (Prop) and trailing limb angle (TLA) independently predicted 6MWT distance, R2 = .655, F(6, 36) = 11.38, P {$<$} .001. Interestingly, only {$\Delta$}Prop predicted {$\Delta$}6MWT; however, pretraining Prop, pretraining TLA, and {$\Delta$}TLA moderated this relationship (moderation model R2s = .383, .468, .289, respectively). Conclusions. The paretic limb's ability to generate propulsion during walking is a critical determinant of long-distance walking function after stroke. This finding supports the development of poststroke interventions that target deficits in propulsion and trailing limb angle.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A higher energy cost of walking poststroke has been linked to reduced walking performance and reduced participation in the community. OBJECTIVE: To determine the contribution of postintervention improvements in walking speed and spatiotemporal gait asymmetry to the reduction in the energy cost of walking after stroke. METHODS: In all, 42 individuals with chronic hemiparesis ({$>$}6 months poststroke) were recruited to participate in 12 weeks of walking rehabilitation. The energy cost of walking, walking speed, and step length, swing time, and stance time asymmetries were calculated pretraining and posttraining. Sequential regression analyses tested the cross-sectional (ie, pretraining) and longitudinal (ie, posttraining changes) relationships between the energy cost of walking versus speed and each measure of asymmetry. RESULTS: Pretraining walking speed ({$\beta$} = -.506) and swing time asymmetry ({$\beta$} = .403) predicted pretraining energy costs: adj R (2) = 0.713; F(3, 37) = 34.05; P {$<$} .001. In contrast, change in walking speed ({$\beta$} = .340) and change in step length asymmetry ({$\beta$} = .934) predicted change in energy costs with a significant interaction between these independent predictors: adj R (2) = 0.699; F(4, 31) = 21.326; P {$<$} .001. Moderation by the direction or the magnitude of pretraining asymmetry was not found. CONCLUSIONS: For persons in the chronic phase of stroke recovery, faster and more symmetric walking after intervention appears to be more energetically advantageous than merely walking faster or more symmetrically. This finding has important functional implications, given the relationship between the energy cost of walking and community walking participation.},

  abstract = {Background. Neurorehabilitation efforts have been limited in their ability to restore walking function after stroke. Recent work has demonstrated proof-of-concept for a functional electrical stimulation (FES)--based combination therapy designed to improve poststroke walking by targeting deficits in paretic propulsion. Objectives. To determine the effects on the energy cost of walking (EC) and long-distance walking ability of locomotor training that combines fast walking with FES to the paretic ankle musculature (FastFES). Methods. Fifty participants {$>$}6 months poststroke were randomized to 12 weeks of gait training at self-selected speeds (SS), fast speeds (Fast), or FastFES. Participants' 6-minute walk test (6MWT) distance and EC at comfortable (EC-CWS) and fast (EC-Fast) walking speeds were measured pretraining, posttraining, and at a 3-month follow-up. A reduction in EC-CWS, independent of changes in speed, was the primary outcome. Group differences in the number of 6MWT responders and moderation by baseline speed were also evaluated. Results. When compared with SS and Fast, FastFES produced larger reductions in EC (Ps {$\leq$}.03). FastFES produced reductions of 24\% and 19\% in EC-CWS and EC-Fast (Ps {$<$}.001), respectively, whereas neither Fast nor SS influenced EC. Between-group 6MWT differences were not observed; however, 73\% of FastFES and 68\% of Fast participants were responders, in contrast to 35\% of SS participants. Conclusions. Combining fast locomotor training with FES is an effective approach to reducing the high EC of persons poststroke. Surprisingly, differences in 6MWT gains were not observed between groups. Closer inspection of the 6MWT and EC relationship and elucidation of how reduced EC may influence walking-related disability is warranted.},

  abstract = {Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects on common poststroke gait compensations of a soft wearable robot (exosuit) designed to assist the paretic limb during hemiparetic walking. Design: A single-session study of eight individuals in the chronic phase of stroke recovery was conducted. Two testing conditions were compared: walking with the exosuit powered versus walking with the exosuit unpowered. Each condition was 8 minutes in duration. Results: Compared with walking with the exosuit unpowered, walking with the exosuit powered resulted in reductions in hip hiking (27 [6\%], P = 0.004) and circumduction (20 [5\%], P = 0.004). A relationship between changes in knee flexion and changes in hip hiking was observed (Pearson r = -0.913, P {$<$} 0.001). Similarly, multivariate regression revealed that changes in knee flexion ([beta] = -0.912, P = 0.007), but not ankle dorsiflexion ([beta] = -0.194, P = 0.341), independently predicted changes in hip hiking (R2 = 0.87, F(2, 4) = 13.48, P = 0.017). Conclusions: Exosuit assistance of the paretic limb during walking produces immediate changes in the kinematic strategy used to advance the paretic limb. Future work is necessary to determine how exosuit-induced reductions in paretic hip hiking and circumduction during gait training could be leveraged to facilitate more normal walking behavior during unassisted walking.

The gaits of 12 young and 12 elderly participants were recorded and analysed using a synchronized PEAK motion analysis system and a force platform during normal walking. Altogether, 24 gait features describing the three types of gait characteristics were extracted for developing gait recognition models and later testing of generalization performance. Test results indicated an overall accuracy of 91.7\% by the SVM in its capacity to distinguish the two gait patterns. The classification ability of the SVM was found to be unaffected across six kernel functions (linear, polynomial, radial basis, exponential radial basis, multi-layer perceptron and spline). Gait recognition rate improved when features were selected from different gait data type. A feature selection algorithm demonstrated that as little as three gait features, one selected from each data type, could effectively distinguish the age groups with 100\% accuracy. These results demonstrate considerable potential in applying SVMs in gait classification for many applications.},

Automated recognition of gait changes has many advantages including, early identification of at-risk gait and monitoring the progress of treatment outcomes. In this paper, we apply an artificial intelligence technique [support vector machines (SVM)] for the automatic recognition of young-old gait types from their respective gait-patterns. Minimum foot clearance (MFC) data of 30 young and 28 elderly participants were analyzed using a PEAK-2D motion analysis system during a 20-min continuous walk on a treadmill at self-selected walking speed. Gait features extracted from individual MFC histogram-plot and Poincare/spl acute/-plot images were used to train the SVM. Cross-validation test results indicate that the generalization performance of the SVM was on average 83.3\% (/spl plusmn/2.9) to recognize young and elderly gait patterns, compared to a neural network's accuracy of 75.0/spl plusmn/5.0. A "hill-climbing" feature selection algorithm demonstrated that a small subset (3-5) of gait features extracted from MFC plots could differentiate the gait patterns with 90\% accuracy. Performance of the gait classifier was evaluated using areas under the receiver operating characteristic plots. Improved performance of the classifier was evident when trained with reduced number of selected good features and with radial basis function kernel. These results suggest that SVMs can function as an efficient gait classifier for recognition of young and elderly gait patterns, and has the potential for wider applications in gait identification for falls-risk minimization in the elderly.},

Data collected from 22 healthy subjects (21 to 85 years) walking at three self-selected speeds were used to validate the algorithm against the GaitRite system. Comparable levels of accuracy and significantly lower detection delays were achieved with respect to other published methods. The algorithm robustness was tested on ten healthy subjects performing sudden speed changes and on ten stroke subjects (43 to 89 years). For healthy subjects, F1-scores of 1 and mean detection delays lower than 14 ms were obtained. For stroke subjects, F1-scores of 0.998 and 0.944 were obtained for IC and EC, respectively, with mean detection delays always below 31 ms.

  abstract = {An original signal processing algorithm is presented to automatically extract, on a stride-by-stride basis, four consecutive fundamental events of walking, heel strike (HS), toe strike (TS), heel-off (HO), and toe-off (TO), from wireless accelerometers applied to the right and left foot. First, the signals recorded from heel and toe three-axis accelerometers are segmented providing heel and toe flat phases. Then, the four gait events are defined from these flat phases. The accelerometer-based event identification was validated in seven healthy volunteers and a total of 247 trials against reference data provided by a force plate, a kinematic 3D analysis system, and video camera. HS, TS, HO, and TO were detected with a temporal accuracy \textpm{} precision of 1.3 ms \textpm{} 7.2 ms, -4.2 ms \textpm{} 10.9 ms, -3.7 ms \textpm{} 14.5 ms, and -1.8 ms \textpm{} 11.8 ms, respectively, with the associated 95\% confidence intervals ranging from -6.3 ms to 2.2 ms. It is concluded that the developed accelerometer-based method can accurately and precisely detect HS, TS, HO, and TO, and could thus be used for the ambulatory monitoring of gait features computed from these events when measured concurrently in both feet.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Walking after stroke is characterized by slow gait speed, poor endurance, reduced quality and adaptability of walking patterns, and an inability to coordinate the legs. Estimates based on mechanical work calculations have suggested that the paretic leg does 30\% to 40\% of the total mechanical work over the gait cycle, regardless of hemiparetic severity, but these work estimates may not describe the contribution of each leg to forward propulsion. The purpose of this study was to establish a quantifiable link between hemiparetic severity and paretic leg contribution to propulsion during walking, which we propose to quantify using a measure based on the anterior-posterior ground reaction forces (A-P GRFs).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nMETHODS: A total of 47 participants with chronic hemiparesis walked at self-selected speeds to collect spatiotemporal parameters and 3D GRFs. A 16-person subset also participated in a pedaling protocol to compare A-P GRF measures to established measures of paretic leg output.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: A-P GRF measures were correlated with both walking speed and hemiparetic severity. These measures were also strongly correlated with positive work and net work values obtained during the pedaling task. The percentage of total propulsion generated by the paretic leg (PP) was calculated and found to be 16\%, 36\%, and 49\% for those with high, moderate, and low hemiparetic severity, respectively.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: PP was found to provide a quantitative measure of the coordinated output of the paretic leg. Further research on this measure of forward propulsion may lead to the provision of an effective tool for distinguishing functional compensation from physiological restitution.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To identify the clinical measures associated with improved walking speed after locomotor rehabilitation in individuals poststroke and how those who respond with clinically meaningful changes in walking speed differ from those with smaller speed increases. Design: A single group pre-post intervention study. Participants were stratified on the basis of a walking speed change of greater than (responders) or less than (nonresponders).16m/s. Paired sample t tests were run to assess changes in each group, and correlations were run between the change in each variable and change in walking speed. Setting: Outpatient interdisciplinary rehabilitation research center. Participants: Hemiparetic subjects (N=27) (17 left hemiparesis; 19 men; age: 58.74\textpm 12.97y; 22.70\textpm 16.38mo poststroke). Intervention: A 12-week locomotor intervention incorporating training on a treadmill with body weight support and manual trainers accompanied by training overground walking. Main Outcome Measures: Measures of motor control, balance, functional walking ability, and endurance were collected at pre- and postintervention assessments. Results: Eighteen responders and 9 nonresponders differed by age (responders=63.6y, nonresponders=49.0y, P=.001) and the lower extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment score (responders=24.7, nonresponders=19.9, P=.003). Responders demonstrated an average improvement of.27m/s in walking speed as well as significant gains in all variables except daily step activity and paretic step ratio. Conversely, nonresponders demonstrated statistically significant improvements only in walking speed and endurance. However, the walking speed increase of.10m/s was not clinically meaningful. Change in walking speed was negatively correlated with changes in motor control in the nonresponder group, implying that walking speed gains may have been accomplished via compensatory mechanisms. Conclusions: This study is a step toward discerning the underlying factors contributing to improved walking performance.},

To reduce the cost and simplify the evaluation, inertial sensors and adaptive algorithms have been utilized, respectively. This paper aims to summarize studies that applied adaptive also called artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to gait analysis based on inertial sensor data, verifying if they can support the clinical evaluation. Articles were identified through searches of the main databases, which were encompassed from 1968 to October 2016. We have identified 22 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The included papers were analyzed due to their data acquisition and processing methods with specific questionnaires. Concerning the data acquisition, the mean score is 6.1~\textpm ~1.62, what implies that 13 of 22 papers failed to report relevant outcomes. The quality assessment of AI algorithms presents an above-average rating (8.2~\textpm ~1.84). Therefore, AI algorithms seem to be able to support gait analysis based on inertial sensor data. Further research, however, is necessary to enhance and standardize the application in patients, since most of the studies used distinct methods to evaluate healthy subjects.},

The hemiparetic subjects walked on the treadmill at their comfortable speeds, while each control walked at the same speed as the hemiparetic subject with whom he or she was matched. Kinematic and insole pressure data were collected from multiple, steady-state gait cycles. A large set of gait differences found between hemiparetic and non-disabled subjects was consistent with impaired swing initiation in the paretic limb (i.e., inadequate propulsion of the leg during pre-swing, increased percentage swing time, and reduced knee flexion at toe-off and mid-swing in the paretic limb) and related compensatory strategies (i.e., pelvic hiking and swing-phase propulsion and circumduction of the paretic limb). Exaggerated positive work associated with raising the trunk during pre-swing and swing of the paretic limb, consistent with pelvic hiking, contributed to increased mechanical energetic cost during walking. A second set of gait differences found was consistent with impaired single limb support on the paretic limb (i.e., shortened support time on the paretic limb) and related compensatory strategies (i.e., exaggerated propulsion of the non-paretic limb during pre-swing to shorten its swing time). Other significant gait differences included asymmetry in step length and increased step width. We conclude that consistent gait differences exist between hemiparetic and non-disabled subjects walking at matched speeds. The differences provide insights, concerning hemiparetic impairment and related compensatory strategies, that are in addition to the observation of slow walking speed.},

  abstract = {Following stroke many individuals are left with neurological and functional deficits, including hemiparesis, which impair their ability to walk. Our previous work reported that propulsion of the paretic leg during pre-swing is impaired and may limit gait speed and knee flexion during swing. To elucidate the mechanism of this impairment, we assessed the mechanical work produced by the hip, knee, and ankle moments during pre-swing of the paretic limb in a group of stroke subjects and compared it with the work produced by non-disabled controls walking at similar speeds. Kinematic and kinetic gait data were collected from 23 hemiparetic and 10 control subjects. The hemiparetic subjects walked at their self-selected speeds. The controls walked at their self-selected and two or three slower speeds. Even when compared to controls walking at slow speeds, ankle plantarflexor work during pre-swing was greatly reduced (-0.136\textpm 0.062 J/kg) in the hemiparetic subjects. Differences in hip (+0.006\textpm 0.020 J/kg) and knee (+0.040\textpm 0.026 J/kg) moment work partially offset the reduction in ankle work, but net joint moment work was still significantly reduced (-0.088\textpm 0.056 J/kg). The reduction in work accounts for the low energy of the paretic limb at the stance-to-swing transition previously reported. Future investigation is needed to determine if targeted training of the plantarflexors in the paretic limb improves swing-phase function and locomotor performance in hemiparetic individuals.},

  abstract = {Evidence suggests that the nervous system controls motor tasks using a low-dimensional modular organization of muscle activation. However, it is not clear if such an organization applies to coordination of human walking, nor how nervous system injury may alter the organization of motor modules and their biomechanical outputs. We first tested the hypothesis that muscle activation patterns during walking are produced through the variable activation of a small set of motor modules. In 20 healthy control subjects, EMG signals from eight leg muscles were measured across a range of walking speeds. Four motor modules identified through nonnegative matrix factorization were sufficient to account for variability of muscle activation from step to step and across speeds. Next, consistent with the clinical notion of abnormal limb flexion-extension synergies post-stroke, we tested the hypothesis that subjects with post-stroke hemiparesis would have altered motor modules, leading to impaired walking performance. In post-stroke subjects ( n = 55), a less complex coordination pattern was shown. Fewer modules were needed to account for muscle activation during walking at preferred speed compared with controls. Fewer modules resulted from merging of the modules observed in healthy controls, suggesting reduced independence of neural control signals. The number of modules was correlated to preferred walking speed, speed modulation, step length asymmetry, and propulsive asymmetry. Our results suggest a common modular organization of muscle coordination underlying walking in both healthy and post-stroke subjects. Identification of motor modules may lead to new insight into impaired locomotor coordination and the underlying neural systems.},

Therefore three different datasets are developed: raw voltage values, calibrated sensor signals and a calibrated estimation of total ground reaction force and position of the plantar center of pressure. The method is tested on a pool of 5 healthy subjects, through a leave-one-out cross validation. The results show high classification performances achieved using estimated biomechanical variables, being on average the 96\%. Calibrated signals and raw voltage values show higher delays and dispersions in phase transition detection, suggesting a lower reliability for online applications.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine whether the walking activity of persons with stroke could be increased through participation in a step activity monitoring program and to assess whether this occurred through a change in the structure of walking activity. Method: Sixteen individuals living with chronic stroke (46 months post-stroke) wore a StepWatch Activity Monitor (SAM) and completed a four-week goal centered activity monitoring program. Descriptors of step activity were averaged across baseline and the last week of monitoring, and were used to analyze the changes. Descriptors of step activity included: steps per day, bouts per day, steps per bout, total time walking per day, and the number of short (540 steps), medium (41--500 steps), and long (4500 steps) walking bouts. Results: As a group, the number of steps per day significantly increased over the four weeks of activity monitoring (p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.005). Subjects also demonstrated a significant improvement in the total time walking (p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.023), and the number of medium (p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.033) and long (p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.050) walking bouts. At the baseline and the final assessment, more than half of the bouts were short bouts of walking (67.6 \textpm{} 8\% and 68.2 \textpm{} 8\% respectively). Conclusions: A goal centered step activity monitoring program can improve daily walking activity after stroke through increases in the amount of total time walking, and medium and long walking bouts.},

Investigate whether an exercise intervention can enhance mobility, prevent falls, and increase physical activity among community-dwelling people after stroke. Method. A randomized trial with blinding of physical outcome assessment was conducted through local stroke clubs. Both groups, on average 5.9 years poststroke, received exercise classes, advice, and a home program for 12 months.The experimental group (EG) program (n = 76) aimed to improve walking, prevent falls and increase physical activity. The control group (CG) program (n = 75) aimed to improve upper-limb and cognitive functions. The primary outcomes were walking capacity, walking speed measured before and after the intervention, and fall rates monitored monthly. Results. At 12 months, the EG walked 34 m further in 6 minutes (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1950; P {$<$} .001) and 0.07 m/s faster over 10 m (95\% CI = 0.01-0.14; P = .03) than the CG. The EG had 129 falls, and the CG had 133.There were no differences in proportion of fallers (relative risk = 1.22; 95\% CI = 0.91-1.62; P = .19) or the rate of falls between groups (incidence rate ratio = 0.96; 95\% CI = 0.59-1.51; P = .88).

  abstract = {A new method of measuring joint angle using a combination of accelerometers and gyroscopes is presented. The method proposes a minimal sensor configuration with one sensor module mounted on each segment. The model is based on estimating the acceleration of the joint center of rotation by placing a pair of virtual sensors on the adjacent segments at the center of rotation. In the proposed technique, joint angles are found without the need for integration, so absolute angles can be obtained which are free from any source of drift. The model considers anatomical aspects and is personalized for each subject prior to each measurement. The method was validated by measuring knee flexion-extension angles of eight subjects, walking at three different speeds, and comparing the results with a reference motion measurement system. The results are very close to those of the reference system presenting very small errors (rms=1.3, mean=0.2, SD=1.1 deg) and excellent correlation coefficients (0.997). The algorithm is able to provide joint angles in real-time, and ready for use in gait analysis. Technically, the system is portable, easily mountable, and can be used for long term monitoring without hindrance to natural activities.},

Body-worn inertial sensor based gait analyses provide a feasible alternative to optometric and pressure based measurements of spatiotemporal gait characteristics. We assessed validity and relative and absolute reliability of a body-worn inertial sensor system (RehaGait\textregistered ) for measuring spatiotemporal gait characteristics compared to a standard stationary treadmill (Zebris\textregistered ). Spatiotemporal gait parameters (walking speed, stride length, cadence and stride time) were collected for 24 healthy seniors (age: 75.3~\textpm ~6.7 years) tested on 2 days (1 week apart) simultaneously using the sensor based system and instrumented treadmill. Each participant completed walking tests (200 strides) at different walking speeds and slopes. The difference between the RehaGait\textregistered system and the treadmill was trivial (Cohen's d~{$<$}0.2) except for speed and stride length at slow speed (Cohen's d, 0.35 and 0.49, respectively). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were excellent for temporal gait characteristics (cadence and stride time; ICC: 0.99--1.00) and moderate for stride length (ICC: 0.73--0.89). Both devices had excellent day-to-day reliability for all gait parameters (ICC: 0.82--0.99) except for stride length at slow speed (ICC: 0.74). The RehaGait\textregistered is a valid and reliable tool for assessing spatiotemporal gait parameters for treadmill walking at different speeds and slopes.},

  abstract = {In human walking, the center of mass motion is similar to an inverted pendulum. Viewing double support as a transition from one inverted pendulum to the next, we hypothesized that the leading leg performs negative work to redirect the center of mass velocity, while simultaneously, the trailing leg performs positive work to replace the lost energy. To test this hypothesis, we developed a method to quantify the external mechanical work performed by each limb (individual limbs method). Traditional measures of external mechanical work use the sum of the ground reaction forces acting on the limbs (combined limbs method) allowing for the mathematical cancellation of simultaneous positive and negative work during multiple support periods. We expected to find that the traditional combined limbs method underestimates external mechanical work by a substantial amount. We used both methods to measure the external mechanical work performed by humans walking over a range of speeds. We found that during double support, the legs perform a substantial amount of positive and negative external work simultaneously. The combined limbs measures of positive and negative external work were approximately 33\% less than those calculated using the individual limbs method. At all speeds, the trailing leg performs greater than 97\% of the double support positive work while the leading leg performs greater than 94\% of the double support negative work. r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {In the single stance phase of walking, center of mass motion resembles that of an inverted pendulum. Theoretically, mechanical work is not necessary for producing the pendular motion, but work is needed to redirect the center of mass velocity from one pendular arc to the next during the transition between steps. A collision model predicts a rate of negative work proportional to the fourth power of step length. Positive work is required to restore the energy lost, potentially exacting a proportional metabolic cost. We tested these predictions with humans (N=9) walking over a range of step lengths (0.4-1.1 m) while keeping step frequency fixed at 1.8 Hz. We measured individual limb external mechanical work using force plates, and metabolic rate using indirect calorimetry. As predicted, average negative and positive external mechanical work rates increased with the fourth power of step length (from 1 W to 38 W; r2=0.96). Metabolic rate also increased with the fourth power of step length (from 7 W to 379 W; r2=0.95), and linearly with mechanical work rate. Mechanical work for step-to-step transitions, rather than pendular motion itself, appears to be a major determinant of the metabolic cost of walking.},

One group received training on a treadmill with the use of body-weight support 2 months after the stroke had occurred (early locomotor training), the second group received this training 6 months after the stroke had occurred (late locomotor training), and the third group participated in an exercise program at home managed by a physical therapist 2 months after the stroke (home-exercise program). Each intervention included 36 sessions of 90 minutes each for 12 to 16 weeks. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants in each group who had an improvement in functional walking ability 1 year after the stroke.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nRESULTS: At 1 year, 52.0\% of all participants had increased functional walking ability. No significant differences in improvement were found between early locomotor training and home exercise (adjusted odds ratio for the primary outcome, 0.83; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.50 to 1.39) or between late locomotor training and home exercise (adjusted odds ratio, 1.19; 95\% CI, 0.72 to 1.99). All groups had similar improvements in walking speed, motor recovery, balance, functional status, and quality of life. Neither the delay in initiating the late locomotor training nor the severity of the initial impairment affected the outcome at 1 year. Ten related serious adverse events were reported (occurring in 2.2\% of participants undergoing early locomotor training, 3.5\% of those undergoing late locomotor training, and 1.6\% of those engaging in home exercise). As compared with the home-exercise group, each of the groups receiving locomotor training had a higher frequency of dizziness or faintness during treatment (P=0.008). Among patients with severe walking impairment, multiple falls were more common in the group receiving early locomotor training than in the other two groups (P=0.02).\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: Locomotor training, including the use of body-weight support in stepping on a treadmill, was not shown to be superior to progressive exercise at home managed by a physical therapist.

Elastic gaits can be either bilaterally symmetric (e.g. run and trot) or asymmetric (e.g. skip, canter and gallop), yet only symmetric pendular gaits (e.g. walk) are observed in nature. Does minimizing metabolic and mechanical power constrain pendular gaits to temporal symmetry? We measured rates of metabolic energy expenditure and calculated mechanical power production while healthy humans walked symmetrically and asymmetrically at a range of step and stride times. We found that walking with a 42 per cent step time asymmetry required 80 per cent (2.5 W kg(-1)) more metabolic power than preferred symmetric gait. Positive mechanical power production increased by 64 per cent (approx. 0.24 W kg(-1)), paralleling the increases we observed in metabolic power. We found that when walking asymmetrically, subjects absorbed more power during double support than during symmetric walking and compensated by increasing power production during single support. Overall, we identify inherent metabolic and mechanical costs to gait asymmetry and find that symmetry is optimal in healthy human walking.},

  abstract = {Background. Regular physical activity is vital for cardiovascular health. Time spent in sedentary behaviors (eg, sitting, lying down) also is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The pattern in which sedentary time is accumulated is important---with prolonged periods of sitting time being particularly deleterious. People with stroke are at high risk for cardiovascular disease, including recurrent stroke. Purpose. This systematic review aimed to update current knowledge of physical activity and sedentary behaviors among people with stroke living in the community. A secondary aim was to investigate factors associated with physical activity levels. Data Sources. The data sources used were MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Allied and Complimentary Medicine Database (AMED), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Study Selection. Studies involving people with stroke living in the community and utilizing objective measures of physical activity or sedentary behaviors were included. Data Extraction. Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked for accuracy by a second person. Data Synthesis. Twenty-six studies, involving 983 participants, were included. The most common measure of activity was steps per day (22 studies), which was consistently reported as less than half of age-matched normative values. Only 4 studies reported on sedentary time specifically. No studies described the pattern by which sedentary behaviors were accumulated across the day. Walking ability, balance, and degree of physical fitness were positively associated with higher levels of physical activity. Limitations. This review included only studies of people living in the community after stroke who were able to walk, and the majority of included participants were aged between 65 and 75 years of age. C.

For orthoses that control the knee, an ideal system would only locate sensors at the thigh and knee, thereby facilitating sensor and electronics integration with the assistive device. To determine potential gait phase identification approaches, classification was implemented using J-48 Decision Tree, Random Forest, Multi-layer Perceptrons, and Support Vector Machine classifiers, along with 5-fold (5-FCV) and 10-fold cross validation (10-FCV). Knee angle, thigh angular velocity, and thigh acceleration were obtained from 31 able-bodied participants during walking (10 strides each). Strides were segmented into Loading Response, Push-Off, Swing, and Terminal Swing and features were extracted using a 0.1 second sliding window. Gait phase classification was performed with and without the knee angle parameter. J-48 Decision Tree with the knee angle parameter was ranked the best classifier due to its second highest classification accuracy of 97.5\% and lowest mean absolute error of 0.014. Results without the knee angle parameter differed by only 0.5\% and 0.003. Therefore, an inertial sensor with accelerometer and gyroscope output, located at the thigh, is a viable approach for classifying gait phases for intelligent orthosis control.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous reports of the mechanics and energetics of post-stroke hemiparetic walking have either not combined estimates of mechanical and metabolic energy or computed external mechanical work based on the limited combined limbs method. Here we present a comparison of the mechanics and energetics of hemiparetic and unimpaired walking at a matched speed. METHODS: Mechanical work done on the body centre of mass (COM) was computed by the individual limbs method and work done at individual leg joints was computed with an inverse dynamics analysis. Both estimates were converted to average powers and related to simultaneous estimates of net metabolic power, determined via indirect calorimetry. Efficiency of positive work was calculated as the ratio of average positive mechanical power [Formula: see text] to net metabolic power. RESULTS: Total [Formula: see text] was 20\% greater for the hemiparetic group (H) than for the unimpaired control group (C) (0.49 vs. 0.41 W . kg(-1)). The greater [Formula: see text] was partly attributed to the paretic limb of hemiparetic walkers not providing appropriately timed push-off [Formula: see text] in the step-to-step transition. This led to compensatory non-paretic limb hip and knee [Formula: see text] which resulted in greater total mechanical work. Efficiency of positive work was not different between H and C. CONCLUSIONS: Increased work, not decreased efficiency, explains the greater metabolic cost of hemiparetic walking post-stroke. Our results highlighted the need to target improving paretic ankle push-off via therapy or assistive technology in order to reduce the metabolic cost of hemiparetic walking.},

  abstract = {Background: automatic recognition of human movement is an effective strategy to assess abnormal gait patterns. Machine learning approaches are mainly applied due to their ability to work with multidimensional nonlinear features. Purpose: to compare several machine learning algorithms employed for gait pattern recognition in motor disorders using discriminant features extracted from gait dynamics. Additionally, this work highlights procedures that improve gait recognition performance. Methods: we conducted an electronic literature search on Web of Science, IEEE, and Scopus, using ``human recognition'', ``gait patterns'', and ``feature selection methods'' as relevant keywords. Results: analysis of the literature showed that kernel principal component analysis and genetic algorithms are efficient at reducing dimensional features due to their ability to process nonlinear data and converge to global optimum. Comparative analysis of machine learning performance showed that support vector machines (SVMs) exhibited higher accuracy and proper generalization for new instances. Conclusions: automatic recognition by combining dimensional data reduction, cross-validation and normalization techniques with SVMs may offer an objective and rapid tool for investigating the subject's clinical status. Future directions comprise the real-time application of these tools to drive powered assistive devices in free-living conditions.},

The aim of this study is to evaluate if the energy cost of walking (CW), in a mixed group of chronic patients with neurological diseases almost 6 months after discharge from rehabilitation wards, can predict the walking performance and any walking restriction on community activities, as indicated by Walking Handicap Scale categories (WHS). One hundred and seven subjects were included in the study, 31 suffering from Stroke, 26 from Spinal Cord Injury and 50 from Multiple Sclerosis. The multivariable binary logistical regression analysis has produced a statistical model with good characteristics of fit and good predictability. This model generated a cut-off value of.40, which enabled us to classify correctly the cases with a percentage of 85.0\%. Our research reveal that, in our subjects, CW is the only predictor of the walking performance of in the community, to be compared with the score of WHS. We have been also identifying a cut-off value of CW cost, which makes a distinction between those who can walk in the community and those who cannot do it. In particular, these values could be used to predict the ability to walk in the community when discharged from the rehabilitation units, and to adjust the rehabilitative treatment to improve the performance.},

  abstract = {Walking uphill and downhill can be challenging for community-dwelling old adults. We investigated the effects of age on leg muscle activity amplitudes and timing during level, uphill, and downhill walking. We hypothesized that old adults would exhibit smaller increases in ankle extensor muscle activities and greater increases in hip extensor muscle activities compared to young adults during uphill vs. level walking. We also hypothesized that, compared to level walking, antagonist leg muscle coactivation would be disproportionately greater in old vs. young adults during downhill walking. Ten old (72 \AE{} 5 yrs) and ten young (25 \AE{} 4 yrs) subjects walked at 1.25 m/s on a treadmill at seven grades (08, \AE 38, \AE 68, \AE 98). We quantified the stance phase electromyographic activities of the gluteus maximus (GMAX), biceps femoris (BF), rectus femoris (RF), vastus medialis (VM), medial gastrocnemius (MG), soleus (SOL), and tibialis anterior (TA). Old adults exhibited smaller increases in MG activity with steeper uphill grade than young adults (e.g., +136\% vs. +174\% at 98). A disproportionate recruitment of hip muscles led to GMAX activity approaching the maximum isometric capacity of these active old adults at steep uphill grades (e.g., old vs. young, 73\% MVC vs. 33\% MVC at +98). Neither uphill nor downhill walking affected the greater coactivation of antagonist muscles in old vs. young adults. We conclude that the disproportionate recruitment of hip muscles with advanced age may have critical implications for maintaining independent mobility in old adults, particularly at steeper uphill grades.},

We hypothesized that: (1) old adults would exhibit smaller peak ankle joint kinetics and larger peak hip joint kinetics than young adults during both level and uphill walking and (2) these age-related differences in ankle and hip joint kinetics would be greatest during uphill vs. level walking. We quantified the sagittal plane ankle, knee, and hip joint kinetics of 10 old adults (mean \AE{} SD, age: 72 \AE{} 5 yrs) and 8 young adults (age: 27 \AE{} 5 yrs) walking at 1.25 m/s on a dual-belt, force-measuring treadmill at four grades (08, +38, +68, +98). As hypothesized, old adults walked with smaller peak ankle joint kinetics (e.g., power generation: \`A18\% at +98) and larger peak hip joint kinetics (e.g., power generation: +119\% at +98) than young adults, most evident during the late stance phase of both level and uphill conditions. Old adults performed two to three times more single support positive work than young adults via muscles crossing the knee. In partial support of our second hypothesis, the age-related reduction in peak ankle joint moments was greater during uphill (\`A0.41 Nm/kg) vs. level (\`A0.30 Nm/kg) walking. However, old adults that exhibited reduced propulsive ankle function during level walking could perform 44\% more trailing leg positive ankle joint work to walk uphill. Our findings indicate that maintaining ankle power generation and trailing leg propulsive function should be the primary focus of ``prehabilitation'' strategies for old adults to preserve their uphill walking ability.},

The purpose of this study was to reexamine factors that predict home and community ambulators determined from real-world walking activity data using activity monitors. METHODS Secondary analyses of real-world walking activity from 2 stroke trials. Home (100-2499 steps/d), most limited community (2500-4499 steps/d), least limited community (5000-74 999), and full community ({$\geq$}7500 steps/d) walking categories were developed based on normative data. Independent variables to predict walking categories were comfortable and fast gait speed, 6-minute walk test, Berg Balance Scale, Fugl Meyer, and Stroke Impact Scale. Data were analyzed using multivariate analyses to identify significant variables associated with walking categories, bootstrap method to select the most stable model and receiver-operating characteristic to identify cutoff values. RESULTS Data from 441 individuals poststroke were analyzed. The 6-minute walk test, Fugl Meyer, and Berg Balance Scale combined were the strongest predictors of home versus community and limited versus unlimited community ambulators. The 6-minute walk test was the strongest individual variable in predicting home versus community (receiver-operating characteristic area under curve=0.82) and limited versus full community ambulators (receiver-operating characteristic area under curve=0.76). A comfortable gait speed of 0.49 m/s discriminated between home and community and a comfortable gait speed of 0.93 m/s discriminated between limited community and full community ambulators. CONCLUSIONS The 6-minute walk test was better able to discriminate among home, limited community, and full community ambulators than comfortable gait speed. Gait speed values commonly used to distinguish between home and community walkers may overestimate walking activity.},

  abstract = {Measurement of the ground reaction forces (GRF) during walking is typically limited to laboratory settings, and only short observations using wearable pressure insoles have been reported so far. In this study, a new proxy measurement method is proposed to estimate the vertical component of the GRF (vGRF) from wearable accelerometer signals. The accelerations are used as the proxy variable. An orthogonal forward regression algorithm (OFR) is employed to identify the dynamic relationships between the proxy variables and the measured vGRF using pressure-sensing insoles. The obtained model, which represents the connection between the proxy variable and the vGRF, is then used to predict the latter. The results have been validated using pressure insoles data collected from nine healthy individuals under two outdoor walking tasks in non-laboratory settings. The results show that the vGRFs can be reconstructed with high accuracy (with an average prediction error of less than 5.0\%) using only one wearable sensor mounted at the waist (L5, fifth lumbar vertebra). Proxy measures with different sensor positions are also discussed. Results show that the waist acceleration-based proxy measurement is more stable with less inter-task and inter-subject variability than the proxy measures based on forehead level accelerations. The proposed proxy measure provides a promising low-cost method for monitoring ground reaction forces in real-life settings and introduces a novel generic approach for replacing the direct determination of difficult to measure variables in many applications.},

Design: Cross-sectional, intact groups research design. Setting: Biomechanics research laboratory. Participants: Forty-three patients were stratified into 2 groups based on the Hoehn and Yahr (H\&Y) disability score, which heavily favors balance in determining disability. The 2 groups were: H\&Y score of 2.0 or less (nϭ23; age, 61Ϯ10y) or H\&Y score of 2.5 or higher (nϭ20; age, 70Ϯ9y). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: The peak COP-COM distance represents the maximum separation between the location of the whole-body COM and the ground reaction force's COP, and thus is an indicator of dynamic balance control. The peak COP-COM was evaluated during 3 phases of the COP trajectory during a gait initiation task. Results: The peak magnitude of the COP-COM distance was significantly greater during the end of the single-support phase in the less disabled patients (H\&Y score Յ2.0) than in more balance disabled patients (H\&Y score Ն2.5) (Pϭ.004). Conclusions: The differences in COP-COM distances between these H\&Y groups suggest that patients with PD who have impaired postural control produce shorter COM-COP distances than do persons without clinically detectable balance impairment. This method of evaluation could prove a useful quantitative index to examine the impact of interventions designed to improve ambulation and balance in PD.},

Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the potential benefits PRT on GI performance in people with Parkinson's disease. Eighteen individuals with idiopathic PD were randomly assigned to either a twice weekly PRT program or a non-contact control group for 10 weeks. Biomechanical analysis of GI was performed pre- and post-intervention. Dependent variables of interest included the displacement of the center-of-pressure (COP) during the anticipatory postural phase of GI as well as the initial stride length and velocity. The PRT group demonstrated improvements in the posterior displacement of the COP and the initial stride length and velocity. There were no improvements in any variables for the control subjects.

We found that average EMG profiles varied in a predictable way with speed. The average EMG profile for each muscle at any speed could be estimated in a simple way from two functions, one constant and one proportionally increasing with walking speed. By taking into account the similarity among profiles within functional groups, the number of basic functions could be reduced further. Any average EMG profile among the 14 leg muscles studied at all speeds in the measured range could be predicted from six constant and ten speed-dependent basic patterns.

  abstract = {Background: Propulsive force generation is critical to walking speed. Trialing limb angle and ankle moment are major contributors to increases in propulsive force during gait. For able-bodied individuals, trailing limb angle contributes twice as much as ankle moment to increases in propulsive force during speed modulation. The aim of this study was to quantify the relative contribution of ankle moment and trailing limb angle to increases in propulsive force for individuals poststroke. Methods: A biomechanical-based model previously developed for able-bodied individuals was evaluated and enhanced for individuals poststroke. Gait analysis was performed as subjects (N = 24) with chronic poststroke hemiparesis walked at their self-selected and fast walking speeds on a treadmill. Results: Both trailing limb angle and ankle moment increased during speed modulation. In the paretic limb, the contribution from trailing limb angle versus ankle moment to increases in propulsive force is 74\% and 17\%. In the non-paretic limb, the contribution from trailing limb angle versus ankle moment to increases in propulsive force is 67\% and 22\%. Conclusions: Individuals poststroke increase propulsive force mainly by changing trailing limb angle in both the paretic and non-paretic limbs. This strategy may contribute to the inefficiency in poststroke walking patterns. Future work is needed to examine whether these characteristics can be modified via intervention.},

  abstract = {Recent rehabilitation approaches for individuals poststroke have focused on improving walking speed because it is a reliable measurement that is associated with quality of life. Previous studies have demonstrated that propulsion, the force used to propel the body forward, determines walking speed. However, there are several different ways of measuring propulsion and no studies have identified which measurement best reflects differences in walking speed. The primary purposes of this study were to determine for individuals poststroke, which measurement of propulsion (1) is most closely related to their self-selected walking speeds and (2) best reflects changes in walking speed within a session. Participants (N{$\frac{1}{4}$} 43) with chronic poststroke hemiparesis walked at their self-selected and maximal walking speeds on a treadmill. Propulsive impulse, peak propulsive force, and mean propulsive value (propulsive impulse divided by duration) were analyzed. In addition, each participant's cadence was calculated. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to determine the relationships between different measurements of propulsion versus walking speed as well as changes in propulsion versus changes in walking speed. Stepwise linear regression was used to determine which measurement of propulsion best predicted walking speed and changes in walking speed. The results showed that all 3 measurements of propulsion were correlated to walking speed, with peak propulsive force showed the strongest correlation. Similarly, when participants increased their walking speeds, changes in peak propulsive forces showed the strongest correlation to changes in walking speed. In addition, multiplying each measurement by cadence improved the correlations. The present study suggests that measuring peak propulsive force and cadence may be most appropriate of the variables studied to characterize propulsion in individuals poststroke.},

  abstract = {Background: Wearable sensor systems can provide data for at-home gait analyses and input to controllers for rehabilitation devices but they often have reduced estimation accuracy compared to laboratory systems. The goal of this study is to evaluate a portable, low-cost system for measuring ground reaction forces and ankle joint torques in treadmill walking and calf raises. Methods: To estimate the ground reaction forces and ankle joint torques, we developed a custom instrumented insole and a tissue force sensor. Six healthy subjects completed a collection of movements (calf raises, 1.0 m/s walking, and 1.5 m/s walking) on two separate days. We trained artificial neural networks on the study data and compared the estimates to a multi-camera motion system and an instrumented treadmill. We evaluated the relative strength of each sensor by testing each sensor's ability to predict the ankle joint torque calculated from a reference inverse kinematics algorithm. We assessed model accuracy through root mean squared error and normalized root mean square error. We hypothesized that the estimation of the models would have normalized root mean square error measures less than 10 \%. Results: For walking at 1.0 and walking at 1.5 m/s, the single-task, intra-day and multi-task, intra-day predictions had normalized root mean square error less than 10 \% for all three force components and both center of pressure components. For the calf raise task, the single-task, intra-day and multi-task, intra-day predictions had normalized root mean square error less than 10 \% for only the anterior-posterior center of pressure. The multi-task, intra-day model had similar predictions to the single-task, intra-day model. The normalized root mean square error of predictions from the insole sensor alone were less than 10 \% for walking at 1.0 m/s and 1.5 m/s. No sensor was sufficient for the calf raise task. The combination of the insole sensor and the tendon sensor had lower normalized root mean square error than the individual sensors for all three tasks. Conclusions: The proposed sensor system provided accurate estimates for five of the six components of the ground reaction kinetics during walking at 1.0 and 1.5 m/s and one of the six components during the calf raise task. The normalized root mean square error of the predictions of the ground reaction forces were similar to published studies using commercial devices. The proposed system of low-cost sensors can provide useful estimations of ankle joint torque for both walking and calf raises for future studies in mobile gait analysis.},

We hypothesized that failure to effectively recruit both hip flexor and ankle plantarflexor muscles of the paretic side limits the potential to increase walking speed in lower functioning hemiparetic subjects. To test this hypothesis, we measured gait kinematics and kinetics of 12 persons with hemiparesis following stroke at self-selected and fast walking conditions. Two groups were identified: (1) lower functioning subjects (n = 6) who increased normalized walking speed from 0.52 leg lengths/s (ll/s, SEM: 0.04) to 0.72 ll/s (SEM: 0.03) and (2) higher functioning subjects (n = 6) who increased walking speed from 0.88 ll/s (SEM: 0.04) to 1.4 ll/s (SEM 0.03). Changes in spatiotemporal parameters, joint kinematics and kinetics between self-selected and fast walking were compared to control subjects examined at matched walking speeds (0.35 ll/s (SEM: 0.03), 0.63 ll/s (SEM: 0.03), 0.92 ll/s (SEM: 0.04) and 1.4 ll/s (SEM: 0.04)). Similar to speed-matched controls, the higher functioning hemiparetic subjects increased paretic limb hip flexion power and ankle plantarflexion power to increase walking speed. The lower functioning hemiparetic subjects did not increase power generation at the hip or ankle to increase walking speed. This observation suggests that impaired ankle power generation combined with saturation of hip power generation limits the potential to increase walking speed in lower functioning hemiparetic subjects.},

Objective.The authors evaluated the efficacy of EMG-BFB applied in a task-oriented approach based on principles of motor learning to increase peak ankle power of the affected leg and gait velocity in patients with chronic mild to moderate hemiparesis. Methods. They assigned 20 participants randomly to the EMG-BFB group or a control group that received conventional therapy for the same duration. Quantitative gait analysis was performed before and after treatment. The EMG-BFB involved the triceps surae during functional gait activities. Treatment was administered with a fading frequency of BFB application and an increasing variability in gait activities. Both groups had 20 treatment sessions of 45 minutes each, including at least 15 minutes of walking-related therapy for the control group. Follow-up (FU) gait analysis was obtained 6 weeks after training. Results. BFB treatment led to significant increases (P {$<$} .01) in peak ankle power at push-off (from 0.63 W/kg to 1.04 W/kg) in conjunction with significant increases in velocity (from 28.3 \%h/s---normalized to percentage height per second---to 39.6 \%h/s) and stride length (from 44.5 \%h---normalized to percentage height---to 57.6 \%h). Increases remained significant at FU.There were no changes in any gait variable in the control group. Conclusion.A task-oriented BFB treatment was effective in increasing peak ankle power, gait velocity, and stride length in a population with hemiparesis. Further studies should compare the combination intervention with either of its components in more impaired patients.},

Their assessment is conventionally achieved using laboratory-based equipment that cannot be applied in daily life monitoring. In this study, we propose a method to predict GRF\&amp;M during walking, using exclusively kinematic information from fully-ambulatory inertial motion capture (IMC). From the equations of motion, we derive the total external forces and moments. Then, we solve the indeterminacy problem during double stance using a distribution algorithm based on a smooth transition assumption. The agreement between the IMC-predicted and reference GRF\&amp;M was categorized over normal walking speed as excellent for the vertical ({$\rho$} = 0.992, rRMSE = 5.3\%), anterior ({$\rho$} = 0.965, rRMSE = 9.4\%) and sagittal ({$\rho$} = 0.933, rRMSE = 12.4\%) GRF\&amp;M components and as strong for the lateral ({$\rho$} = 0.862, rRMSE = 13.1\%), frontal ({$\rho$} = 0.710, rRMSE = 29.6\%), and transverse GRF\&amp;M ({$\rho$} = 0.826, rRMSE = 18.2\%). Sensitivity analysis was performed on the effect of the cut-off frequency used in the filtering of the input kinematics, as well as the threshold velocities for the gait event detection algorithm. This study was the first to use only inertial motion capture to estimate 3D GRF\&amp;M during gait, providing comparable accuracy with optical motion capture prediction. This approach enables applications that require estimation of the kinetics during walking outside the gait laboratory.},

Despite the demonstrated benefits of these conservative treatments, their clinical adoption is currently obstructed by the high complexity, spatial demands, and cost of optical motion capture systems. In this study we propose and evaluate a wearable visual feedback system for gait retraining of the foot progression angle (FPA). Methods: The primary components of the system are inertial measurement units, which track the human movement without spatial limitations, and an augmented reality headset used to project the visual feedback in the visual field. The adapted gait protocol contained five different target angles ranging from 15 degrees toe-out to 5 degrees toe-in. Eleven healthy participants walked on an instrumented treadmill, and the protocol was performed using both an established laboratory visual feedback driven by optical motion capture, and the proposed wearable system. Results and conclusions: The wearable system tracked FPA with an accuracy of 2.4 degrees RMS and ICC=0.94 across all target angles and subjects, when compared to an optical motion capture reference. In addition, the effectiveness of the biofeedback, reflected by the number of steps with FPA value \textpm 2 degrees from the target, was found to be around 50\% in both wearable and laboratory approaches. These findings demonstrate that retraining of the FPA using wearable inertial sensing and visual feedback is feasible with effectiveness matching closely an established laboratory method. The proposed wearable setup may reduce the complexity of gait retraining applications and facilitate their transfer to routine clinical practice.},

To date, the conventional input used in this analysis is derived from optical motion capture (OMC) and force plate (FP) systems, which restrict the application of musculoskeletal models to gait laboratories. To address this problem, we propose the use of inertial motion capture to perform musculoskeletal model-based inverse dynamics by utilizing a universally applicable ground reaction force and moment (GRF\&M) prediction method. Validation against a conventional laboratory-based method showed excellent Pearson correlations for sagittal plane joint angles of ankle, knee, and hip ({$\rho$} = 0.95, 0.99, and 0.99, respectively) and root-mean-squared-differences (RMSD) of 4.1 \textpm{} 1.3{$^\circ$}, 4.4 \textpm{} 2.0{$^\circ$}, and 5.7 \textpm{} 2.1{$^\circ$}, respectively.

  abstract = {The popularity of using accelerometer-based systems to quantify human movement patterns has increased in recent years for clinicians and researchers alike. The benefits of using accelerometers compared to more traditional gait analysis instruments include low cost; testing is not restricted to a laboratory environment; accelerometers are small, therefore walking is relatively unrestricted; and direct measurement of 3D accelerations eliminate errors associated with differentiating displacement and velocity data. However, accelerometry is not without its disadvantages, an issue which is scarcely reported in gait analysis literature. This paper reviews the use of accelerometer technology to investigate gait-related movement patterns, and addresses issues of acceleration measurement important for experimental design. An overview of accelerometer mechanics is provided before illustrating specific experimental conditions necessary to ensure the accuracy of gaitrelated acceleration measurement. A literature review is presented on how accelerometry has been used to examine basic temporospatial gait parameters, shock attenuation, and segmental accelerations of the body during walking. The output of accelerometers attached to the upper body has provided useful insights into the motor control of normal walking, age-related differences in dynamic postural control, and gait patterns in people with movement disorders.},

The actual reduction in vertical displacement was also calculated. Setting: A gait laboratory. Participants: Thirty able-bodied subjects. Main Outcome Measure: The estimated reduction in COM vertical displacement caused by pelvic rotation was compared with the actual reduction in COM displacement. Results: The estimated effect of pelvic rotation in reducing COM displacement was 2.5 Ϯ 1.1mm, accounting for only 12\% of the actual reduction. Conclusion: During normal comfortable speed walking by able-bodied subjects, pelvic rotation contributes only a small portion of the actual reduction in the vertical displacement of the COM compared with a compass gait model. Other primary gait factors or determinants are needed to explain the actual reduction in vertical displacement of the COM.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose---Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a popular poststroke gait rehabilitation intervention. Although stroke causes multijoint gait deficits, FES is commonly used only for the correction of swing-phase foot drop. Ankle plantarflexor muscles play an important role during gait. The aim of the current study was to test the immediate effects of delivering FES to both ankle plantarflexors and dorsiflexors on poststroke gait. Methods---Gait analysis was performed as subjects (Nϭ13) with chronic poststroke hemiparesis walked at their self-selected walking speeds during walking with and without FES. Results---Compared with delivering FES to only the ankle dorsiflexor muscles during the swing phase, delivering FES to both the paretic ankle plantarflexors during terminal stance and dorsiflexors during the swing phase provided the advantage of greater swing-phase knee flexion, greater ankle plantarflexion angle at toe-off, and greater forward propulsion. Although FES of both the dorsiflexor and plantarflexor muscles improved swing-phase ankle dorsiflexion compared with noFES, the improvement was less than that observed by stimulating the dorsiflexors alone, suggesting the need to further optimize stimulation parameters and timing for the dorsiflexor muscles during gait. Conclusions---In contrast to the typical FES approach of stimulating ankle dorsiflexor muscles only during the swing phase, delivering FES to both the plantarflexor and dorsiflexor muscles can help to correct poststroke gait deficits at multiple joints (ankle and knee) during both the swing and stance phases of gait. Our study shows the feasibility and advantages of stimulating the ankle plantarflexors during FES for poststroke gait. (Stroke. 2009;40:3821-3827.)},

  abstract = {Wearable technology has been viewed as one of the plausible alternatives to capture human motion in an unconstrained environment, especially during running. However, existing methods require kinematic and kinetic measurements of human body segments and can be complicated. This paper investigates the use of neural network model (NN) and accelerometer to estimate vertical ground reaction force (VGRF). An experimental study was conducted to collect sufficient samples for training, validation and testing. The estimated results were compared with VGRF measured using an instrumented treadmill. The estimates yielded an average root mean square error of less than 0.017 of the body weight (BW) and a cross-correlation coefficient greater than 0.99. The results also demonstrated that NN could estimate impact force and active force with average errors ranging between 0.10 and 0.18 of BW at different running speeds. Using NN and uniaxial accelerometer can (1) simplify the estimation of VGRF, (2) reduce the computational requirement and (3) reduce the necessity of multiple wearable sensors to obtain relevant parameters.},

Using data from the 2005 National Health Interview Survey (n = 31,482), this paper reports on the prevalence of transportation walking and leisure walking for U.S. adults and examines the variation in prevalence across different socio-demographic groups. The prevalence of transportation walking and leisure walking for U.S. adults ({$\geq$}5 days/week for {$\geq$} 30 min/day) was calculated using data from the 2005 National Health Interview Survey. Results. In the United States, 41.5\% of adults walked for leisure and 28.2\% walked for transportation in intervals of at least 10 min. The highest prevalence of transportation walking was among black non-Hispanic men (36.0\%) and Asian/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander women (40.5\%). The highest prevalence of leisure walking was among Asian/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander men (42.0\%) and white non-Hispanic women (46.6\%). Leisure walking was most prevalent among respondents with higher incomes and education levels, whereas transportation walking increased in prevalence with education level but decreased with income level. Based on the findings, 6\% of U.S. adults were considered regularly active ({$\geq$} 5 days/week for {$\geq$} 30 min/day) by walking for transportation and 9\% were regularly active by walking for leisure. Conclusion. Leisure and transportation walking have distinctly different demographic correlates. These differences should guide interventions aimed at influencing walking for different purposes.

  abstract = {In computational models of human walking, both magnitude and timing of locomotor propulsion are important for mechanical and metabolic efficiency, suggesting that these are likely tightly controlled by the neuromuscular system. Studies of actual human walking have focused primarily on magnitude-related measures of propulsion, often ignoring its timing. The purpose of this study was to quantify the timing of onset and peak propulsion relative to contralateral heel strike (HS) in healthy, young adults walking at multiple speeds. Propulsion was quantified at the groundlevel using the anterior component of the anteroposterior ground reaction force, the limb-level using individual limb power, and the joint-level using ankle power. Contrary to common computational models, most of our timing-related measures indicated that propulsion occurred after contralateral HS. Timing-related measures of propulsion also changed with walking speed -- as speed increased, individuals initiated propulsion earlier in the support phase. Timing of locomotor propulsion is theoretically important for walking performance, especially metabolic efficiency, and could therefore provide important clinical information. This study provides a set of relatively simple metrics that can be used to quantify propulsion and benchmark data that can be used for future comparisons with individuals or populations with gait impairments.},

  abstract = {A healthy gait pattern depends on an array of biomechanical features, orchestrated by the central nervous system for economy and stability. Injuries and other pathologies can alter these features and result in substantial gait deficits, often with detrimental consequences for energy expenditure and balance. An understanding of the role of biomechanics in the generation of healthy gait, therefore, can provide insight into these deficits. This article examines the basic principles of gait from the standpoint of dynamic walking, an approach that combines an inverted pendulum model of the stance leg with a pendulum model of the swing leg and its impact with the ground. The heel-strike at the end of each step has dynamic effects that can contribute to a periodic gait and its passive stability. Biomechanics, therefore, can account for much of the gait pattern, with additional motor inputs that are important for improving economy and stability. The dynamic walking approach can predict the consequences of disruptions to normal biomechanics, and the associated observations can help explain some aspects of impaired gait. This article reviews the basic principles of dynamic walking and the associated experimental evidence for healthy gait and then considers how the principles may be applied to clinical gait pathologies},

Methods: A list of criteria was used to evaluate functional community ambulation among participants. Physiological variables, such as the heart rate, oxygen uptake and the lactate concentration, were also measured. Results: Three of nine incomplete SCI subjects and all able-bodied subjects were able to meet all the criteria measured. The required velocity to safely cross an intersection was the criterion that the incomplete SCI group had the most diculty reaching. The able-bodied subjects had a comfortable walking velocity twice that of the incomplete SCI subjects' preferred velocity. When walking at the same velocity (incomplete SCI subjects' preferred velocity), the incomplete SCI subjects had a rate of oxygen uptake 26\% greater than the healthy subjects and were 200\% less ecient. The lactate concentration also proved to be a useful tool when evaluating the incomplete SCI subjects' walking eciency. The incomplete SCI subjects lactate concentration increased after walking at their preferred velocity, meaning that the anaerobic pathways were used to meet energy demands. Conclusion: Rehabilitation centers should adapt their evaluation forms and increase their criteria requirements to more suitable criteria that are found in the SCI patient's community. The physiological cost should also be taken into consideration when evaluating the SCI patient's functional ambulation.},

  abstract = {Review question We wanted to compare the effects of virtual reality versus an alternative treatment or no treatment on recovery after stroke using arm function and other outcomes such as walking speed and independence in managing daily activities after stroke. Background Many people after having a stroke have difficulty moving, thinking, and sensing. This often results in problems with everyday activities such as writing, walking, and driving. Virtual reality and interactive video gaming are types of therapy being provided to people after having a stroke. The therapy involves using computer-based programs designed to simulate real life objects and events. Virtual reality and interactive video gaming may have some advantages over traditional therapy approaches as they can give people an opportunity to practise everyday activities that are not or cannot be practised within the hospital environment. Furthermore, there are several features of virtual reality programs that might mean that patients spend more time in therapy: for example, the activity might be more motivating. Study characteristics We identified 72 studies involving 2470 people after stroke. A wide range of virtual reality programs were used, with most aimed to improve either arm function or walking ability. The evidence is current to April 2017. Key results Twenty-two trials tested whether the use of virtual reality compared with conventional therapy resulted in an improved ability to use one's arm and found that the use of virtual reality did not result in better function (low-quality evidence). When virtual reality was used in addition to usual care or rehabilitation to increase the amount of time the person spent in therapy there were improvements in the functioning of the arm (low-quality evidence). Six trials tested whether the use of virtual reality compared with conventional therapy resulted in improved walking speed. There was no evidence that virtual reality was more effective in this case (low-quality evidence). Ten trials found that there was some evidence that virtual reality resulted in a slightly better ability to manage everyday activities such as showering and dressing (moderate-quality evidence). However, these positive effects were found soon after the end of the treatment and it is not clear whether the effects are long lasting. Results should be interpreted with caution as, while there are a large number of studies, the studies are generally small and not of high quality. A small number of people using virtual reality reported pain, headaches, or dizziness. No serious adverse events were reported. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence was generally of low or moderate quality. The quality of the evidence for each outcome was limited due to small numbers of study participants, inconsistent results across studies, and poor reporting of study details.},

Purpose: There is clear evidence that physical activity, including walking, has substantial benefits for health. This article, prepared as part of the proceedings of a conference on walking and health, discusses the type of walking that produces substantial health benefits, considers several methodological issues pertinent to epidemiologic studies investigating the association of walking and health, and reviews some of the reasons for the large public health importance of walking. Methods: Review of the available literature. Due to space constraints, this is not intended to be a comprehensive review; instead, selected studies are cited to illustrate the points raised. Results: Walking as a healthful form of physical activity began to receive attention in the 1990s due to new recommendations that emphasized moderate-intensity physical activity. The main example of moderate-intensity activity in the 1995 Centers for Disease Control/American College of Sports Medicine recommendation was brisk walking at 3 to 4 mph. Evidence for the health benefits of walking comes largely from epidemiologic studies. When interpreting the data from such studies, it is necessary to consider several methodological issues, including the design of the study, confounding by other lifestyle behaviors, and confounding by other kinds of physical activity. Walking has the potential to have a large public health impact due to its accessibility, its documented health benefits, and the fact that effective programs to promote walking already exist. Conclusions: Walking is a simple health behavior that can reduce rates of chronic disease and ameliorate rising health care costs, with only a modest increase in the number of activity-related injuries.},

This study was designed to determine if multi-session balance training with and without biofeedback leads to changes in balance performance in healthy older adults; and if changes persist after training. 36 participants (age 60--88) were randomly divided into two groups. Both groups trained on seven stance and gait tasks for 2 consecutive weeks (3\^A/ week) while trunk angular sway and task duration were monitored. One group received real-time multimodal biofeedback of trunk sway and a control group trained without biofeedback. Training effects were assessed at the last training session, with biofeedback available to the feedback group. Post-training effects (without biofeedback) were assessed immediately after, 1-week, and 1-month post-training. Both groups demonstrated training effects; participants swayed less when standing on foam with eyes closed (EC), maintained tandem-stance EC longer, and completed 8 tandem-steps EC faster and with less sway at the last training session. Changes in sway and duration, indicative of faster walking, were also observed after training for other gait tasks. While changes in walking speed persisted post-training, few other post-training effects were observed. These data suggest there is little added benefit to balance training with biofeedback, beyond training without, in healthy older adults. However, transient use of wearable balance biofeedback systems as balance aides remains beneficial for challenging balance situations and some clinical populations.},

The number of IMUs and their measurement locations are often determined heuristically, and the rationale underlying the selection of these parameter values is not discussed. Using the dynamic relationship between the center of mass (CoM), the GRFs and joint kinetics, we propose the CoM as a single measurement location with which to predict the dynamic data of the lower limbs, using an ANN. Data from seven subjects walking on a treadmill at various speeds were collected from a single IMU worn near the sacrum. The data was segmented by step and numerically processed for integration. Six segment angles of the stance and swing leg, three joint torques, and two GRFs were estimated from the kinematics of the CoM measured from a single IMU sensor, with fair accuracy. These results indicate the importance of the CoM as a dynamic determinant of multi-segment kinetics during walking. The tradeoff between data quantity and wearable convenience can be solved by utilizing a machine learning algorithm based on the dynamic characteristics of human walking.},

  abstract = {Rapid unloading and a peak in power output of the ankle joint have been widely observed during push-off in human walking. Modelbased studies hypothesize that this push-off causes redirection of the body center of mass just before touch-down of the leading leg. Other research suggests that work done by the ankle extensors provides kinetic energy for the initiation of swing. Also, muscle work is suggested to power a catapult-like action in late stance of human walking. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the biomechanical process leading to this widely observed high power output of the ankle extensors. In our study, we use kinematic and dynamic data of human walking collected at speeds between 0.5 and 2.5\,m\,s-1 for a comprehensive analysis of push-off mechanics. We identify two distinct phases, which divide the push-off: first, starting with positive ankle power output, an alleviation phase, where the trailing leg is alleviated from supporting the body mass, and second, a launching phase, where stored energy in the ankle joint is released. Our results show a release of just a small part of the energy stored in the ankle joint during the alleviation phase. A larger impulse for the trailing leg than for the remaining body is observed during the launching phase. Here, the buckling knee joint inhibits transfer of power from the ankle to the remaining body. It appears that swing initiation profits from an impulsive ankle push-off resulting from a catapult without escapement.},

A simple four-state left-right HMM is trained on a dataset of signals collected from a mono-axial gyro during treadmill walking trials performed at different speed and incline values. The gyro is mounted at the foot instep, with its sensitivity axis oriented in the medio-lateral direction. A rule based method applied to gyro signals is used for data annotation. Sensitivity and specificity of phase classification detection higher than 95\% are obtained.

  abstract = {Machine learning methods have been widely used for gait assessment through the estimation of spatio-temporal parameters. As a further step, the objective of this work is to propose and validate a general probabilistic modeling approach for the classification of different pathological gaits. Specifically, the presented methodology was tested on gait data recorded on two pathological populations (Huntington's disease and post-stroke subjects) and healthy elderly controls using data from inertial measurement units placed at shank and waist. By extracting features from group-specific Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and signal information in time and frequency domain, a Support Vector Machines classifier (SVM) was designed and validated. The 90.5\% of subjects was assigned to the right group after leave-one-subject--out cross validation and majority voting. The long-term goal we point to is the gait assessment in everyday life to early detect gait alterations.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Background and Purpose. Initiation of gait requires transitions from relatively stationary positions to stability with movement and from double- to single-limb stances. These are deliberately destabilizing activities that may be difficult for people with early Parkinson disease (PD), even when they have no problems with level walking. We studied differences in postural stability during gait initiation between participants with early and middle stages of PD (characterized by Hoehn and Yahr as stages 1--3) and 2 other groups of participants without PD---older and younger adults. Subjects. The mean ages of the 3 groups of participants were as follows: subjects with PD, 69.3 years (SD=5.7, range=59--78); older subjects without PD, 69.0 years (SD=3.9, range=65--79); and younger subjects without PD, 27.5 (SD=3.9, range=22--35). Methods. A 3-dimensional motion analysis system was used with 2 force platforms to obtain data for center of mass (COM) and center of pressure (COP). The distance between the vertical projections of the COM and the COP (COM--COP distance) was used to reflect postural control during 5 events in gait initiation. Results. By use of multivariate analysis of variance, differences in COM--COP distance were found among the 3 groups. An analysis of variance indicated differences for 4 of the 5 events in gait initiation. A Scheffe post hoc analysis demonstrated differences in gait initiation between the subjects with PD and both groups of subjects without PD (2 events) and between the subjects with PD and the younger subjects without PD (2 events). Discussion and Conclusion. The COM--COP distance relationship was used to measure postural control during the transition from quiet standing to steady-state gait. Differences between groups indicated that individuals with impaired postural control allow less COM--COP distance than do individuals with no known neurologic problems. The method used could prove useful in the development and assessment of interventions to improve ambulation safety and enhance the independence of people with impaired postural control.},

  abstract = {Background.Hemiparetic gait following stroke requires substantial energy consumption,which would promote deconditioning and disability. Optimal modalities for decreasing this energy cost remain challenging. Excessive energy consumption, however, seems to be mainly due to extra positive muscle work to substantially lift the body's center of mass (CM) against gravity during the paretic limb swing. Objective. The authors tested a new rehabilitation strategy in a pilot study to specifically reduce the energy cost in hemiparetic gait. Methods. Six chronic hemiparetic patients underwent a 6-week gait training program on a treadmill with real-time feedback of their CM and were asked to reduce its increased vertical displacement. The authors assessed the walking energy cost, vertical CM displacement, kinematics, and electromyogram activity without feedback before and after treatment. Results. After treatment, the vertical CM displacement decreased by 10\% (P = .005), particularly when the CM vaulted over the nonparetic limb in stance, and the energy cost decreased markedly by 30\% (P = .009).The paretic knee flexion in swing increased concomitantly by 45\% and muscle co-contraction decreased significantly in both thigh muscles by 15\%. Conclusions.The rehabilitation approach followed in this study seems remarkably effective in decreasing the walking energy cost. By treating the compensatory strategy (ie, the increased CM displacement), we also appear to treat primary deviations such as poststroke knee impairments, which is novel and complementary to current concepts in rehabilitation.This new approach is promising and merits further investigation.},

It consisted of four uniaxial seismic accelerometers and one rate gyroscope per body segment. Tests were done with 10 young healthy volunteers, walking at five different speeds on a treadmill. In order to study the system's accuracy, measurements were made with an optic, passive-marker system and the body-mounted system, simultaneously. In all the comparison cases, the curves obtained from the two systems were very close, showing root mean square errors representing o7\% full range in 75\% of the cases (overall mean 6.64\%, standard deviation 4.13\%) and high coefficients of multiple correlation in 100\% of cases (overall mean 0.9812, standard deviation 0.02). Calibration of the body-mounted system is done against gravity. The body-mounted sensors do not hinder natural movement. The calculation algorithms are computationally demanding and only are applicable off-line. The body-mounted sensors are accurate, inexpensive and portable and allow long-term recordings in clinical, sport and ergonomics settings. r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Background: Ankle exoskeletons offer a promising opportunity to offset mechanical deficits after stroke by applying the needed torque at the paretic ankle. Because joint torque is related to gait speed, it is important to consider the user's gait speed when determining the magnitude of assistive joint torque. We developed and tested a novel exoskeleton controller for delivering propulsive assistance which modulates exoskeleton torque magnitude based on both soleus muscle activity and walking speed. The purpose of this research is to assess the impact of the resulting exoskeleton assistance on post-stroke walking performance across a range of walking speeds. Methods: Six participants with stroke walked with and without assistance applied to a powered ankle exoskeleton on the paretic limb. Walking speed started at 60\% of their comfortable overground speed and was increased each minute (n00, n01, n02, etc.). We measured lower limb joint and limb powers, metabolic cost of transport, paretic and non-paretic limb propulsion, and trailing limb angle. Results: Exoskeleton assistance increased with walking speed, verifying the speed-adaptive nature of the controller. Both paretic ankle joint power and total limb power increased significantly with exoskeleton assistance at six walking speeds (n00, n01, n02, n03, n04, n05). Despite these joint- and limb-level benefits associated with exoskeleton assistance, no subject averaged metabolic benefits were evident when compared to the unassisted condition. Both paretic trailing limb angle and integrated anterior paretic ground reaction forces were reduced with assistance applied as compared to no assistance at four speeds (n00, n01, n02, n03). Conclusions: Our results suggest that despite appropriate scaling of ankle assistance by the exoskeleton controller, suboptimal limb posture limited the conversion of exoskeleton assistance into forward propulsion. Future studies could include biofeedback or verbal cues to guide users into limb configurations that encourage the conversion of mechanical power at the ankle to forward propulsion.

Methods: Metabolic, mechanical and electromyographic measurements were made as healthy young (YOU; n = 12, age = 27 \textpm{} 3 years) and older (OLD; n = 20, age = 74 \textpm{} 3 years) men of equivalent body mass and leg length walked on a treadmill at four speeds (ranging from 0.83 to 1.67 m s-1). Results: Net (above resting) CW, determined by indirect calorimetry was 31\% higher (average across speeds) in OLD (P {$<$} 0.05). The integrity of the passive pendulum like interchange of mechanical energies of the centre of mass (COMB), an energy-saving mechanism, was maintained in OLD. Furthermore, total mechanical work, determined from fluctuations in mechanical energy of COMB and of body segments relative to COMB, was not significantly elevated in OLD. This resulted in a lower efficiency in OLD (-17\%, P {$<$} 0.05). Co-activation, temporally quantified from electromyography recordings, was 31\% higher in OLD for antagonist muscles of the thigh (P {$<$} 0.05). Thigh co-activation was moderately correlated with CW at three speeds (r = 0.38--0.52, P {$<$} 0.05). Conclusion: Healthy septuagenarians with no gait impairment have an elevated CW which is not explained by an elevation in whole body mechanical work. Increased antagonist muscle co-activation (possibly an adaptation to ensure adequate joint stability) may offer partial explanation of the elevated CW.},

Design: Descriptive correlational. Setting: Home and community. Participants: Twenty-eight men and 22 women (Nϭ50) over the age 45 years with more than 6 months of hemiparetic gait after ischemic stroke. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Ambulatory activity (total daily step activity), mobility deficit severity (Berg Balance Scale [BBS] scores, timed 10-m walks), and cardiovascular fitness (energy costs of hemiparetic gait, peak exercise capacity [VO2peak]). Results: Mean ambulatory activity profiles were extremely low (2837 steps/d vs reported 5000 -- 6000 steps/d in sedentary older adults). Ambulatory activity levels were strongly associated with BBS scores (rϭ.581, PϽ.001) and self-selected floor walking velocity (rϭ.554, PϽ.001). Participants also had profound cardiovascular 11.7Ϯ2.8mL{$\cdot$}kgϪ1{$\cdot$}minϪ1). deconditioning (mean VO2peak, The energy costs of hemiparetic gait were high (8.7Ϯ1.7mL{$\cdot$}kgϪ1{$\cdot$}minϪ1), representing 76\% of physiologic fitness reserve. Although the relationships of economy of gait and VO2peak to ambulatory activity was not statistically significant, both the VO2peak and the physiologic fitness reserve, as expressed by fractional utilization, were strongly related to balance (rϭ.374, Pϭ.02; rϭϪ.430, PϽ .01, respectively.) The BBS predicted 30\% of the variance in ambulatory activity. Conclusions: Ambulatory activity levels and cardiovascular fitness in patients with chronic stroke are extremely low. Mobility deficits, particularly in balance, are associated with low ambulatory activity. Balance-related inactivity may be an important factor in deconditioning. Further studies are needed to better understand whether task-oriented exercise enhances balance and whether increases in daily ambulatory activity yield improved cardiovascular fitness in chronic stroke survivors.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose---Individuals with chronic stroke often demonstrate a ``plateau,'' or deceleration of motor recovery, which may lead to discharge from physical therapy (PT). However, numerous studies report improvements in motor function when individuals are provided intensive practice of motor tasks. We suggest that reduced task-specific walking practice during clinical PT contributes to limited gains in ambulatory function in those with a perceived plateau poststroke, and suggest that further gains can be realized if intensive stepping, or locomotor training (LT) is provided after discharge. Methods---Twenty subjects with chronic stroke completed a repeated baseline measures, randomized crossover trial in which walking performance was assessed during the last 4 weeks of clinical PT before discharge secondary to reaching a plateau, followed by 4 weeks of intensive LT and 4 weeks of no intervention. Outcome measures included clinical and physiological (metabolic) measures of walking overground and on a treadmill, and measures of daily stepping activity in the home and community, including during clinical PT and subsequent LT sessions. Results---Stepping practice was more than 4-fold higher during LT versus clinical PT sessions, with significant improvements in daily stepping and gait efficiency only after LT. Changes in daily stepping after clinical PT and intensive LT were correlated (PϽ0.001) with the amount of stepping practice received during these interventions. Conclusions---Intensive LT results in improved daily stepping in individuals poststroke who have been discharged from PT because of a perceived plateau in motor function. These improvements may be related to the amount and intensity of stepping practice. (Stroke. 2010;41:129-135.)},

The aim of this study is to determine the feasibility, validity and reliability of a low-cost open-source system incorporating algorithms and a single tri-axial accelerometer-based wearable to quantify gait characteristics in the laboratory and community post-stroke. Methods: Twenty-five participants with stroke wore the wearable (AX3, Axivity) on the lower back during a laboratory 2 minute continuous walk (preferred pace) on two occasions a week apart and continuously in the community for two consecutive 7 day periods. Video, instrumented walkway (GaitRite) and an OPAL accelerometer-based wearable were used as laboratory references. Results: Feasibility of the proposed system was good. The system was valid for measuring step count (ICC 0.899). Inherent differences in gait quantification between algorithm and GaitRite resulted in difficulties comparing agreement between the different systems. Agreement was moderate-excellent (ICC 0.503--0.936) for mean and variability gait characteristics vs. OPAL. Agreement was moderate-poor between the system and OPAL for asymmetry characteristics. Moderateexcellent reliability (ICC 0.534--0.857) was demonstrated for 11/14 laboratory measured gait characteristics. Community test-retest reliability was good-excellent (ICC 0.867--0.983) for all except one (ICC 0.699) of the 19 gait characteristics. Conclusion: The proposed system is a low-cost, reliable tool for quantifying gait post-stroke with multiple potential applications. Further refinement to optimise gait quantification algorithms for certain gait characteristics including gait asymmetry is required.},

  abstract = {Walking is a motor task requiring coordination of many muscles. Previous biomechanical studies, based primarily on analyses of the net ankle moment during stance, have concluded different functional roles for the plantar flexors. We hypothesize that some of the disparities in interpretation arise because of the effects of the uniarticular and biarticular muscles that comprise the plantar flexor group have not been separated. Furthermore, we believe that an accurate determination of muscle function requires quantification of the contributions of individual plantar flexor muscles to the energetics of individual body segments. In this study, we examined the individual contributions of the ankle plantar flexors (gastrocnemius (GAS); soleus (SOL)) to the body segment energetics using a musculoskeletal model and optimization framework to generate a forward dynamics simulation of normal walking at 1.5 m/s. At any instant in the gait cycle, the contribution of a muscle to support and forward progression was defined by its contribution to trunk vertical and horizontal acceleration, respectively, and its contribution to swing initiation by the mechanical energy it delivers to the leg in pre-swing (i.e., double-leg stance prior to toe-off). GAS and SOL were both found to provide trunk support during single-leg stance and pre-swing. In early single-leg stance, undergoing eccentric and isometric activity, they accelerate the trunk vertically but decelerate forward trunk progression. In mid single-leg stance, while isometric, GAS delivers energy to the leg while SOL decelerates it, and SOL delivers energy to the trunk while GAS decelerates it. In late single-leg stance through pre-swing, though GAS and SOL both undergo concentric activity and accelerate the trunk forward while decelerating the downward motion of the trunk (i.e., providing forward progression and support), they execute different energetic functions. The energy produced from SOL accelerates the trunk forward, whereas GAS delivers almost all its energy to accelerate the leg to initiate swing. Although GAS and SOL maintain or accelerate forward motion in mid single-leg stance through pre-swing, other muscles acting at the beginning of stance contribute comparably to forward progression. In summary, throughout single-leg stance both SOL and GAS provide vertical support, in mid single-leg stance SOL and GAS have opposite energetic effects on the leg and trunk to ensure support and forward progression of both the leg and trunk, and in pre-swing only GAS contributes to swing initiation. r 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {This paper presents algorithms for detection of gait initiation and termination using wearable inertial measurement units and pressure-sensitive insoles. Body joint angles, joint angular velocities, ground reaction force and center of plantar pressure of each foot are obtained from these sensors and input into supervised machine learning algorithms. The proposed initiation detection method recognizes two events: gait onset (an anticipatory movement preceding foot lifting) and toe-off. The termination detection algorithm segments gait into steps, measures the signals over a buffer at the beginning of each step, and determines whether this measurement belongs to the final step. The approach is validated with 10 subjects at two gait speeds, using within-subject and subject-independent cross-validation. Results show that gait initiation can be detected timely and accurately, with few errors in the case of within-subject cross-validation and overall good performance in subject-independent cross-validation. Gait termination can be predicted in over 80\% of trials well before the subject comes to a complete stop. Results also show that the two sensor types are equivalent in predicting gait initiation while inertial measurement units are generally superior in predicting gait termination. Potential use of the algorithms is foreseen primarily with assistive devices such as prostheses and exoskeletons. \copyright{} 2013 IPEM.},

Design: Repeated-measures, within-subject design. Setting: Research laboratory. Participants: A total of 9 individuals with chronic hemiparesis poststroke and 7 unimpaired similarly aged controls (NZ16). Intervention: Individuals walked on a treadmill in 2 separate studies. First, we compared the metabolic COW with an anterior force applied to the COM that (1) coincided with paretic propulsion or (2) was applied throughout the gait cycle. Next, we compared the metabolic COW with anterior (assistive) or posterior (resistive) forces applied during paretic propulsion. Main Outcome Measure: Metabolic COW. Results: The COW was significantly greater in the Stroke group. Anterior (propulsive) assistance reduced the COW differently based on group. The Stroke group exhibited a 12\% reduction in COW when assistance was provided only during paretic propulsion, but not when assistance was provided throughout the gait cycle. In contrast, the Control group demonstrated reduced COW during both anterior assistance conditions. In addition, we observed that resistance during paretic propulsion (simulated hemiparesis for Control group) significantly increased the COW. Conclusions: Systematically manipulating propulsive forces at the body's COM had a profound influence on metabolic cost. The timing of propulsive forces to the COM is important and needs to coincide with paretic terminal stance. Additional internally or externally generated propulsive forces applied to the body's COM poststroke may produce a lower metabolic COW.},

  abstract = {Background: Technology-mediated neurorehabilitation is suggested to enhance training intensity and therefore functional gains. Here, we used a novel virtual reality (VR) system for task-specific upper extremity training after stroke. The system offers interactive exercises integrating motor priming techniques and embodied visuomotor feedback. In this pilot study, we examined (i) rehabilitation dose and training intensity, (ii) functional improvements, and (iii) safety and tolerance when exposed to intensive VR rehabilitation. Methods: Ten outpatient stroke survivors with chronic ({$>$}6 months) upper extremity paresis participated in a tensession VR-based upper limb rehabilitation program (2 sessions/week). Results: All participants completed all sessions of the treatment. In total, they received a median of 403 min of upper limb therapy, with 290 min of effective training. Within that time, participants performed a median of 4713 goal-directed movements. Importantly, training intensity increased progressively across sessions from 13.2 to 17.3 movements per minute. Clinical measures show that despite being in the chronic phase, where recovery potential is thought to be limited, participants showed a median improvement rate of 5.3\% in motor function (Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Upper Extremity; FMA-UE) post intervention compared to baseline, and of 15.4\% at one-month follow-up. For three of them, this improvement was clinically significant. A significant improvement in shoulder active range of motion (AROM) was also observed at follow-up. Participants reported very low levels of pain, stress and fatigue following each session of training, indicating that the intensive VR intervention was well tolerated. No severe adverse events were reported. All participants expressed their interest in continuing the intervention at the hospital or even at home, suggesting high levels of adherence and motivation for the provided intervention. Conclusions: This pilot study showed how a dedicated VR system could deliver high rehabilitation doses and, importantly, intensive training in chronic stroke survivors. FMA-UE and AROM results suggest that task-specific VR training may be beneficial for further functional recovery both in the chronic stage of stroke. Longitudinal studies with higher doses and sample sizes are required to confirm the therapy effectiveness. Trial registration: This trial was retrospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov database (registration number NCT03094650) on 14 March 2017.},

In human movement applications, the drift inherent to the accelerometer signals is often reduced by exploiting the cyclical nature of gait and under the hypothesis that the velocity of the sensor is zero at some point in stance. In this study, the validity of the latter hypothesis was investigated by determining the minimum velocity of progression of selected points of the foot and shank during the stance phase of the gait cycle while walking at three different speeds on level ground. The errors affecting the accuracy of the stride length estimation resulting from assuming a zero velocity at the beginning of the integration interval were evaluated on twenty healthy subjects. Results showed that the minimum velocity of the selected points on the foot and shank increased as gait speed increased. Whereas the average minimum velocity of the foot locations was lower than 0.011 m/s, the velocity of the shank locations were up to 0.049 m/s corresponding to a percent error of the stride length equal to 3.3\%. The preferable foot locations for an inertial sensor resulted to be the calcaneus and the lateral aspect of the rearfoot. In estimating the stride length, the hypothesis that the velocity of the sensor can be set to zero sometimes during stance is acceptable only if the sensor is attached to the foot.},

  abstract = {Aging and many pathologies that affect gait are associated with reduced ankle power output and thus trailing limb propulsion during walking. However, quantifying trailing limb propulsion requires sophisticated measurement equipment at significant expense that fundamentally limits clinical translation for diagnostics or gait rehabilitation. As a component of joint power, our purpose was to determine if shank acceleration estimated via accelerometers during push-off can serve as a clinically feasible surrogate for ankle power output and peak anterior ground reaction forces (GRF) during walking. As hypothesized, we found that young adults modulated walking speed via changes in peak anterior GRF and peak ankle power output that correlated with proportional changes in shank acceleration during push-off, both at the individual subject (R2   0.80, p {$<$} 0.01) and group average (R2   0.74, p {$<$} 0.01) levels. In addition, we found that unilateral deficits in trailing limb propulsion induced via a leg bracing elicited unilateral and relatively proportional reductions in peak anterior GRF, peak ankle power, and peak shank acceleration. These unilateral leg bracing effects on peak shank acceleration correlated with those in peak ankle power (braced leg: R2 = 0.43, p = 0.028) but those effects in both peak shank acceleration and peak ankle power were disassociated from those in peak anterior GRF. In conclusion, our findings in young adults provide an early benchmark for the development of affordable and clinically feasible alternatives for assessing and monitoring trailing limb propulsion during walking.},

The aims were 1) to determine the contribution of daily PA to the HRQL of individuals with chronic stroke and 2) to assess the relationship between the functional ability of these individuals to the amount of daily PA. Methods: The amount of daily PA of forty adults with chronic stroke (mean age 66.5 \textpm{} 9.6 years) was monitored using two measures. Accelerometers (Actical) were worn on the hip for three consecutive days in conjunction with a self-report questionnaire [the PA Scale for Individuals with Physical Disabilities (PASIPD)]. The daily physical activity was measured as the mean total accelerometer activity counts/day and the PASIPD scores as the metabolic equivalent (MET) hr/day. HRQL was assessed by the Physical and Mental composite scores of the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 (SF-36) in addition to the functional ability of the participants. Correlation and regression analyses were performed. Results: After controlling for the severity of the motor impairment, the amount of daily PA, as assessed by the PASIPD and accelerometers, was found to independently contribute to 10-12\% of the variance of the Physical Composite Score of the SF-36. No significant relationship was found between PA and the Mental Composite Score of the SF-36.The functional ability of the participants was found to be correlated to the amount of daily PA (r = 0.33 - 0.67, p {$<$} 0.01). Conclusion: The results suggest that daily PA is associated with better HRQL (as assessed by the Physical composite score of the SF-36) for people living with stroke. Daily PA should be encouraged to potentially increase HRQL. Accelerometers in conjunction with a self-report questionnaire may provide important measures of PA which can be monitored and modified, and potentially influence HRQL.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: and OBJECTIVE: Walking speed influences energy cost in healthy adults, but its influence when walking is impaired due to stroke is not clear. This study investigated the effect of manipulating walking speed on the energy economy of walking poststroke. METHODS: . Sixteen persons with chronic stroke underwent a clinical examination, including several lower extremity impairment measures. consumption (VO(2)) was measured as they walked at their self-selected speed (Free), 20\% slower (Slow), their fastest possible speed (Fastest), and 2 speeds between Free and Fastest speeds. VO(2) was normalized to body mass and speed, resulting in energy cost per meter walked (CW). RESULTS: . A main effect for speed was observed (P = .00001), with faster than self-selected speeds showing greater relative economy as a whole. However, for 5 subjects with the fastest walking speeds ({$>$}1.2 m/s), there was a trend toward decreasing relative economy at speeds higher than self-selected speed (P = .18). There was a negative correlation between improvement in CW at the most economical speed and (a) Free speed (r = -.857; P {$<$} .0001) and (b) lower extremity Fugl-Meyer scores (r = -.653; P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: . For those poststroke whose fastest walking speed after stroke is below 1.2 m/s, walking economy improves when speed is increased above the self-selected walking speed. The results suggest that for persons poststroke with very slow self-selected walking speeds, improvements in walking speed could be accompanied by improvements in walking economy if faster walking speeds can be attained through intervention.},

Detection accuracy and precision compared to signals from foot switches were evaluated. The algorithm detected curve features of the vectorial sum of radial and tangential accelerations and mapped those to discrete gait states. The results showed detection rates for healthy and hemiparetic gait ranging form 84.2\% to 108.5\%. The sensitivity was between 0.81 and 1, and the specificity between 0.85 and 1, depending on gait phase and group of subjects. The algorithm detected gait phase changes earlier than the reference.

For example, owing to the size and weight of low-frequency force transducers, most currently available wearable gait measurement systems provide only limited, if any, elements of ground reaction force (GRF) data. To obtain the most GRF information possible with a minimal use of sensors, we propose a GRF estimation method based on biomechanical knowledge of human walking. This includes the dynamics of the center of mass (CoM) during steady human gait resembling the oscillatory behaviors of a mass-spring system. Available measurement data were incorporated into a spring-loaded inverted pendulum with translating pivot. The spring stiffness and simulation parameters were tuned to match, as accurately as possible, the available data and oscillatory characteristics of walking. Our results showed that the model simulation estimated reasonably well the unmeasured GRF. Using the vertical GRF and CoP profile for gait speeds ranging from 0.93 to 1.89 m/s, the anterior-posterior (A-P) GRF was estimated and resulted in an average correlation coefficient of R = 0.982 \textpm{} 0.009. Even when the ground contact timing and gait speed information were alone available, our method estimated GRFs resulting in R = 0.969 \textpm{} 0.022 for the A-P and R = 0.891 \textpm{} 0.101 for the vertical GRFs. This research demonstrates that the biomechanical knowledge of human walking, such as inherited oscillatory characteristics of the CoM, can be used to gain unmeasured information regarding human gait dynamics.},

The adoption of the concept that fundamentally locomotion is the translation of the center of gravity through space along a pathway requiring the least expenditure of energy supplies the necessary unifying principle which permits of qualitative analysis in terms of the essential determinants of gait. The six major determinants are pelvic rotation, pelvic tilt, knee and hip flexion, knee and ankle interaction, and lateral pelvic displacement. The serial observations of irregularities in these determinants provides insight into individual variation and a dynamic assessment of pathological gait. Pathological gait may be viewed as an attempt to preserve as low a level of energy consumption as possible by exaggerations of the motions at unaffected levels. Compensation is reasonably effective with the loss of one determinant of which that at the knee is the most costly. Loss of two determinants makes effective compensation impossible and the cost of locomotion in terms of energy is increased threefold with an inevitable drain upon the body economy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND In individuals with post-stroke hemiparesis, reduced push-off force generation in the paretic leg negatively impacts walking function. Gait training interventions that increase paretic push-off can improve walking function in individuals with neurologic impairment. During normal locomotion, push-off forces are modulated with variations in gait speed and slope. However, it is unknown whether able-bodied individuals can selectively modulate push-off forces from one leg in response to biofeedback. Here, in a group of young, neurologically-unimpaired individuals, we determined the effects of a real-time visual and auditory biofeedback gait training paradigm aimed at unilaterally increasing anteriorly-directed ground reaction force (AGRF) in the targeted leg. METHODS Ground reaction force data during were collected from 7 able-bodied individuals as they walked at a self-selected pace on a dual-belt treadmill instrumented with force platforms. During 11-min of gait training, study participants were provided real-time AGRF biofeedback encouraging a 20-30\% increase in peak AGRF generated by their right (targeted) leg compared to their baseline (pre-training) AGRF. AGRF data were collected before, during, and after the biofeedback training period, as well as during two retention tests performed without biofeedback and after standing breaks. RESULTS Compared to AGRFs generated during the pre-training gait trials, participants demonstrated a significantly greater AGRF in the targeted leg during and immediately after training, indicating that biofeedback training was successful at inducing increased AGRF production in the targeted leg. Additionally, participants continued to demonstrate greater AGRF production in the targeted leg after two standing breaks, showing short-term recall of the gait pattern learned during the biofeedback training. No significant effects of training were observed on the AGRF in the non-targeted limb, showing the specificity of the effects of biofeedback toward the targeted limb. CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate the short-term effects of using unilateral AGRF biofeedback to target propulsion in a specific leg, which may have utility as a training tool for individuals with gait deficits such as post-stroke hemiparesis. Future studies are needed to investigate the effects of real-time AGRF biofeedback as a gait training tool in neurologically-impaired individuals.},

Unlike most robotic devices, the human body lacks even surfaces and right angles. Therefore, we focus on methods that avoid assuming certain orientations in which the sensors are mounted with respect to the body segments. After a review of available methods that may cope with this challenge, we present a set of new methods for: (1) joint axis and position identification; and (2) flexion/extension joint angle measurement. In particular, we propose methods that use only gyroscopes and accelerometers and, therefore, do not rely on a homogeneous magnetic field. We provide results from gait trials of a transfemoral amputee in which we compare the inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based methods to an optical 3D motion capture system. Unlike most authors, we place the optical markers on anatomical landmarks instead of attaching them to the IMUs. Root mean square errors of the knee flexion/extension angles are found to be less than 1{$^\circ$} on the prosthesis and about 3{$^\circ$} on the human leg. For the plantar/dorsiflexion of the ankle, both deviations are about 1{$^\circ$}.},

Subjects were instrumented with two uniaxial accelerometers just below the knee while synchronized ground reaction force (GRF) recordings were used as reference measurements. An automated multiphase algorithm was developed to estimate the time of IC and TC in the acceleration signals of five healthy subjects and two transtibial amputees walking at different walking speeds. The accuracy of the detection algorithm in ten control subjects and eight transtibial amputees indicated mean errors ranging between 0.013 and 0.034 s for the TC and IC timing, with 95\% confidence interval of the individual step errors ranging between -0.062 and 0.115 s. Correlation coefficients between the estimated stance phase duration and GRF data were 0.98 and 0.97 for controls and amputees, respectively. We concluded that IC and TC can be accurately and easily measured using this system in both healthy subjects and transtibial amputees walking at different walking speeds.

  abstract = {Monitoring natural human gait in real-life environments is essential in many applications, including quantification of disease progression, monitoring the effects of treatment, and monitoring alteration of performance biomarkers in professional sports. Walking ground reaction forces are among the key parameters necessary for gait analysis. However, these parameters are commonly measured using force plates or instrumented treadmills which are expensive and bulky and can only be used in a controlled laboratory environment. Despite the importance of real-life gait measurement, developing reliable and practical techniques and technologies necessary for continuous real-life monitoring of gait is still an open challenge, mainly due to the lack of a practical and cost-effective wearable technology for ground reaction force measurement. This paper presents a methodology to estimate the total walking ground reaction force GRFv \dh t\TH{} in the vertical direction using data from a single inertial measurement unit. Correlation analysis of the vertical acceleration of different body segments with GRFv \dh t\TH{} indicated that the 7th cervical vertebrae is one of the best locations for the sensor. The proposed method improves the accuracy of the state-of-the-art GRFv \dh t\TH{} estimation by 25\%, by utilising the time-varying ratio of the vertical acceleration of the human body centre of mass and measured C7 vertical acceleration. Results of this study showed that the proposed method estimated consistently the GRFv \dh t\TH{} in both indoor and urban outdoor environment, with a 4--8\% peak-to-peak normalised root mean square error.},

Recently, technical advances have made it possible also to investigate more complex, realistic motor tasks and to implement not only visual, but also auditory, haptic, or multimodal augmented feedback. The aim of this review is to address the potential of augmented unimodal and multimodal feedback in the framework of motor learning theories. The review addresses the reasons for the different impacts of feedback strategies within or between the visual, auditory, and haptic modalities and the challenges that need to be overcome to provide appropriate feedback in these modalities, either in isolation or in combination. Accordingly, the design criteria for successful visual, auditory, haptic, and multimodal feedback are elaborated.},

Here, we analyze walking energetics and biomechanics for adult chimpanzees and humans to investigate the long-standing hypothesis that bipedalism reduced the energy cost of walking compared with our ape-like ancestors [Rodman PS, McHenry HM (1980) Am J Phys Anthropol 52:103-106]. Consistent with previous work on juvenile chimpanzees [Taylor CR, Rowntree VJ (1973) Science 179:186-187], we find that bipedal and quadrupedal walking costs are not significantly different in our sample of adult chimpanzees. However, a more detailed analysis reveals significant differences in bipedal and quadrupedal cost in most individuals, which are masked when subjects are examined as a group. Furthermore, human walking is approximately 75\% less costly than both quadrupedal and bipedal walking in chimpanzees. Variation in cost between bipedal and quadrupedal walking, as well as between chimpanzees and humans, is well explained by biomechanical differences in anatomy and gait, with the decreased cost of human walking attributable to our more extended hip and a longer hindlimb. Analyses of these features in early fossil hominins, coupled with analyses of bipedal walking in chimpanzees, indicate that bipedalism in early, ape-like hominins could indeed have been less costly than quadrupedal knucklewalking.},

Considering the fact that each individual has a unique way of walking, inertial sensors can be applied to the problem of gait recognition where assessed gait can be interpreted as a biometric trait. Thus, inertial sensor-based gait recognition has a great potential to play an important role in many security-related applications. Since inertial sensors are included in smart devices that are nowadays present at every step, inertial sensor-based gait recognition has become very attractive and emerging field of research that has provided many interesting discoveries recently. This paper provides a thorough and systematic review of current state-of-the-art in this field of research. Review procedure has revealed that the latest advanced inertial sensor-based gait recognition approaches are able to sufficiently recognise the users when relying on inertial data obtained during gait by single commercially available smart device in controlled circumstances, including fixed placement and small variations in gait. Furthermore, these approaches have also revealed considerable breakthrough by realistic use in uncontrolled circumstances, showing great potential for their further development and wide applicability.},

Intervention: Biofeedback (any type delivered by any signal or sense) delivered concurrently during practice of sitting, standing up, standing or walking compared with the same amount of practice without biofeedback. Outcome measures: Measures of activity congruent with the activity trained. Results: Eighteen trials including 429 participants met the inclusion criteria. The quality of the included trials was moderately high, with a mean PEDro score of 6.2 out of 10. The pooled effect size was calculated as a standardised mean difference (SMD) because different outcome measures were used. Biofeedback improved performance of activities more than usual therapy (SMD 0.50, 95\% CI 0.30 to 0.70). Conclusion: Biofeedback is more effective than usual therapy in improving performance of activities. Further research is required to determine the long-term effect on learning.

Understanding how neuromuscular control is altered in CP can provide insight into pathological movement. We sought to determine if individuals with CP demonstrate reduced complexity of neuromuscular control during gait compared with unimpaired individuals and if changes in control are related to functional ability. METHOD Muscle synergies during gait were retrospectively analyzed for 633 individuals (age range 3.9--70y): 549 with CP (hemiplegia, n=122; diplegia, n=266; triplegia, n=73; quadriplegia, n=88) and 84 unimpaired individuals. Synergies were calculated using non-negative matrix factorization from surface electromyography collected during previous clinical gait analyses. Synergy complexity during gait was compared with diagnosis subtype, functional ability, and clinical examination measures. RESULT Fewer synergies were required to describe muscle activity during gait in individuals with CP compared with unimpaired individuals. Changes in synergies were related to functional impairment and clinical examination measures including selective motor control, strength, and spasticity. INTERPRETATION Individuals with CP use a simplified control strategy during gait compared with unimpaired individuals. These results were similar to synergies during walking among adult stroke survivors, suggesting similar neuromuscular control strategies between these clinical populations.},

The classifier is based on a Hierarchical Weighted Decision applied to the outputs of two or more scalar Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) trained by linear accelerations and angular velocities measured at shank and thigh. The kinematics of the dominant lower limb of ten healthy subjects were acquired by means of linear accelerometers and gyroscopes embedded in two inertial sensors. The actual sequence of gait phases was captured by means of foot switches. The experimental procedure consisted in one walking task, repeated for three times, on a treadmill at the preferred velocity of each subject. We compared the performance, in terms of sensitivity and specificity, of both Scalar Classifiers (SCs) and Distributed Classifiers (DCs) based on all the combinations of sagittal acceleration and sagittal angular velocity of the two body segments. The DC based on the angular velocities showed the highest values of sensitivity and specificity. The SC based on the angular velocity of shank was the better among others SCs, but the values of sensitivity and specificity are lower than 0.95. When we use only one sensor, placed on shank or thigh, the DC based on kinematic variables of shank showed better results, but not higher than 0.95. Consequently, the additional information provided by linear acceleration did not improve the performance and then, the gait-phase detection algorithm, which can be implemented in an active knee orthosis, has to be based on the output of two gyroscopes placed on shank and thigh.},

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) represent a viable solution, but they need subject-specific training, making data processing very time-consuming. Here, we validated an inter-subject procedure to avoid the intra-subject one in two, four and six gait-phase models in pediatric subjects. The inter-subject procedure consists in the identification of a standardized parameter set to adapt the model to measurements. We tested the inter-subject procedure both on scalar and distributed classifiers. Ten healthy children and ten hemiplegic children, each equipped with two Inertial Measurement Units placed on shank and foot, were recruited. The sagittal component of angular velocity was recorded by gyroscopes while subjects performed four walking trials on a treadmill. The goodness of classifiers was evaluated with the Receiver Operating Characteristic. The results provided a goodness from good to optimum for all examined classifiers (0 {$<$} G {$<$} 0.6), with the best performance for the distributed classifier in two-phase recognition (G = 0.02). Differences were found among gait partitioning models, while no differences were found between training procedures with the exception of the shank classifier.

  abstract = {In the last years, gait phase partitioning has come to be a challenging research topic due to its impact on several applications related to gait technologies. A variety of sensors can be used to feed algorithms for gait phase partitioning, mainly classifiable as wearable or non-wearable. Among wearable sensors, footswitches or foot pressure insoles are generally considered as the gold standard; however, to overcome some inherent limitations of the former, inertial measurement units have become popular in recent decades. Valuable results have been achieved also though electromyography, electroneurography, and ultrasonic sensors. Non-wearable sensors, such as opto-electronic systems along with force platforms, remain the most accurate system to perform gait analysis in an indoor environment. In the present paper we identify, select, and categorize the available methodologies for gait phase detection, analyzing advantages and disadvantages of each solution. Finally, we comparatively examine the obtainable gait phase granularities, the usable computational methodologies and the optimal sensor placements on the targeted body segments.},

  abstract = {Background: In persons post-stroke, diminished ankle joint function can contribute to inadequate gait propulsion. To target paretic ankle impairments, we developed a neuromechanics-based powered ankle exoskeleton. Specifically, this exoskeleton supplies plantarflexion assistance that is proportional to the user's paretic soleus electromyography (EMG) amplitude only during a phase of gait when the stance limb is subjected to an anteriorly directed ground reaction force (GRF). The purpose of this feasibility study was to examine the short-term effects of the powered ankle exoskeleton on the mechanics and energetics of gait. Methods: Five subjects with stroke walked with a powered ankle exoskeleton on the paretic limb for three 5 minute sessions. We analyzed the peak paretic ankle plantarflexion moment, paretic ankle positive work, symmetry of GRF propulsion impulse, and net metabolic power. Results: The exoskeleton increased the paretic plantarflexion moment by 16\% during the powered walking trials relative to unassisted walking condition (p {$<$} .05). Despite this enhanced paretic ankle moment, there was no significant increase in paretic ankle positive work, or changes in any other mechanical variables with the powered assistance. The exoskeleton assistance appeared to reduce the net metabolic power gradually with each 5 minute repetition, though no statistical significance was found. In three of the subjects, the paretic soleus activation during the propulsion phase of stance was reduced during the powered assistance compared to unassisted walking (35\% reduction in the integrated EMG amplitude during the third powered session). Conclusions: This feasibility study demonstrated that the exoskeleton can enhance paretic ankle moment. Future studies with greater sample size and prolonged sessions are warranted to evaluate the effects of the powered ankle exoskeleton on overall gait outcomes in persons post-stroke.},

The purpose of this review was to summarize and synthesize the findings of studies involving real-time kinematic, temporospatial, and kinetic biofeedback. The goal was to provide a general overview of the effectiveness of these forms of biofeedback in treating gait abnormalities. Data Sources. Articles were identified through searches of the following databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials. All searches were limited to the English language and encompassed the period from 1965 to November 2007. Study Selection. Titles and abstracts were screened to identify studies that met the following requirements: the study included the use of kinematic, temporospatial, or kinetic biofeedback during gait training, and the population of interest showed abnormal movement patterns as a result of a pathology or injury.

All articles that met the inclusion criteria were assessed by use of the Methodological Index for Nonrandomized Studies. Data Synthesis. Seven articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Effect sizes were calculated for the primary outcome variables for all studies that provided enough data. Effect sizes generally suggested moderate to large treatment effects for all methods of biofeedback during practice. Limitations. Several of the studies lacked adequate randomization; therefore, readers should exercise caution when interpreting authors' conclusions. Conclusions. Each biofeedback method appeared to result in moderate to large treatment effects immediately after treatment. However, it is unknown whether the effects were maintained. Future studies should ensure adequate randomization of participants and implementation of motor learning concepts and should include retention testing to assess the long-term success of biofeedback and outcome measures capable of demonstrating coordinative changes in gait and improvement in function.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, various methods for the estimation of gait events and temporal parameters from the acceleration signals of a single inertial measurement unit (IMU) mounted at waist level have been proposed. Despite the growing interest for such methodologies, a thorough comparative analysis of methods with regards to number of extra and missed events, accuracy and robustness to IMU location is still missing in the literature. The aim of this work was to fill this gap. Five methods have been tested on single IMU data acquired from fourteen healthy subjects walking while being recorded by a stereophotogrammetric system and two force platforms. The sensitivity in detecting initial and final contacts varied between 81\% and 100\% across methods, whereas the positive predictive values ranged between 94\% and 100\%. For all tested methods, stride and step time estimates were obtained; three of the selected methods also allowed estimation of stance, swing and double support time. Results showed that the accuracy in estimating step and stride durations was acceptable for all methods. Conversely, a statistical difference was found in the error in estimating stance, swing and double support time, due to the larger errors in the final contact determination. Except for one method, the IMU positioning on the lower trunk did not represent a critical factor for the estimation of gait temporal parameters. Results obtained in this study may not be applicable to pathologic gait.},

Participants: Forty-nine poststroke patients with chronic hemiparesis, stratified into hemiparetic severity subgroups based on Brunnstrom stages of motor recovery, walking at their self-selected speed. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Percent of muscle activity in the paretic and nonparetic legs and net anteroposterior (AP) ground reaction force impulse (ie, the time integral of the AP ground reaction force) within 4 regions of the stance phase (first double support, first and second halves of single support, and second double support). Results: Medial gastrocnemius and soleus muscle activity correlated positively with paretic propulsion in the second half of single support and double support across all subjects and subjects grouped by hemiparetic severity. Tibialis anterior correlated negatively with paretic propulsion during preswing across all subjects and for subjects with moderate and severe hemiparesis. Rectus femoris activity also correlated negatively with preswing propulsion for the severe group. Uniarticular knee extensor activity correlated only with increased paretic braking in the first double-support phase for the severe hemiparesis group. Nonparetic leg muscle activity correlated with propulsive impulses across all subjects, but not within the severe group exclusively. Conclusions: Paretic propulsion is strongly associated with increased plantarflexor activity and also negatively associated with increased leg flexor activity, especially in the severe hemiparesis group. These results suggest that exaggerated flexor muscle activity may counteract the effects of the plantarflexors by offloading the leg and interfering with the limb's ability to generate appropriate AP ground reaction forces. There is also evidence for specific relationships between paretic braking and nonparetic propulsive forces and changes in timing of muscle activation.},

This study aimed to quantify their capacity to restore steady gait after a step modification. Design. This was a cross-sectional, observational study. Methods. Nineteen people in the chronic phase (Ͼ6 months) after stroke (mean ageϭ55.0 years, SDϭ10.1) and 20 people of similar age (mean ageϭ54.6 years, SDϭ12.0) who were able-bodied were included. Participants were instructed to avoid obstacles that were suddenly released in front of the paretic leg (stroke group) or left leg (control group) while walking on a treadmill. Outcomes were success rates of obstacle avoidance as well as post-crossing step length, step duration, hip flexion angle at foot-strike, and peak hip extension of the steps measured within 10 seconds following obstacle release. Results. Success rates of obstacle avoidance were lower for people poststroke. Moreover, their first post-crossing step length and duration (ie, the nonparetic step) deviated more from steady gait than those of people in the control group (ie, the right step), with lower values for people poststroke. Similar deviations were observed for post-crossing hip flexion and extension excursions. Limitations. People poststroke were relatively mildly impaired and used an anklefoot orthosis, which may limit the generalizability of the results to other populations poststroke. Conclusions. People with poststroke foot drop using an ankle-foot orthosis had reduced gait adaptability, as evidenced by lower success rates of obstacle avoidance as well as an impaired capacity to restore steady gait after crossing an obstacle. The latter finding unveils their difficulty in incorporating step modifications in ongoing gait.},

With the introduction of inertial motion capture systems, it becomes possible to measure kinematics in any environment. However, kinetic information could not be provided with such technology. Furthermore, numerous body-worn sensors are required for a full-body motion analysis. The aim of this study is to examine the validity of a method to estimate sagittal knee joint angles and vertical ground reaction forces during running using an ambulatory minimal body-worn sensor setup. Two concatenated artificial neural networks were trained (using data from eight healthy subjects) to estimate the kinematics and kinetics of the runners. The first artificial neural network maps the information (orientation and acceleration) of three inertial sensors (placed at the lower legs and pelvis) to lower-body joint angles. The estimated joint angles in combination with measured vertical accelerations are input to a second artificial neural network that estimates vertical ground reaction forces. To validate our approach, estimated joint angles were compared to both inertial and optical references, while kinetic output was compared to measured vertical ground reaction forces from an instrumented treadmill. Performance was evaluated using two scenarios: training and evaluating on a single subject and training on multiple subjects and evaluating on a different subject. The estimated kinematics and kinetics of most subjects show excellent agreement ({$\rho$} {$>$} 0.99) with the reference, for single subject training. Knee flexion/extension angles are estimated with a mean RMSE {$<$}5\textopenbullet. Ground reaction forces are estimated with a mean RMSE {$<$} 0.27 BW. Additionaly, peak vertical ground reaction force, loading rate and maximal knee flexion during stance were compared, however, no significant differences were found. With multiple subject training the accuracy of estimating discrete and continuous outcomes decreases, however, good agreement ({$\rho$} {$>$} 0.9) is still achieved for seven of the eight different evaluated subjects. The performance of multiple subject learning depends on the diversity in the training dataset, as differences in accuracy were found for the different evaluated subjects.},

  abstract = {The plantarflexors provide a major source of propulsion during walking. When mechanical power generation from the plantarflexor muscles is limited, other joints may compensate to maintain a consistent walking velocity, but likely at increased metabolic cost. The purpose of this study was to determine how a unilateral reduction in ankle plantarflexor power influences the redistribution of mechanical power generation within and across limbs and the associated change in the metabolic cost of walking. Twelve unimpaired young adults walked with an ankle brace on the dominant limb at 1.2 m/s on a dual-belt instrumented treadmill. Lower extremity kinematics and kinetics as well as gas exchange data were collected in two conditions: (1) with the brace unlocked (FREE) and (2) with the brace locked (FIXED). The brace significantly reduced ankle plantarflexion excursion by 12.967 3.601 (p o 0.001) and peak ankle mechanical power by 1.03 7 0.51 W/kg (p o 0.001) in the FIXED versus FREE condition. Consequently, metabolic power (W/kg) of walking in the FIXED condition increased by 7.4\% compared to the FREE condition (p {$\frac{1}{4}$}0.03). Increased bilateral hip mechanical power generation was observed in the FIXED condition (p o0.001). These results suggest that walking with reduced ankle power increases metabolic demand due to the redistribution of mechanical power generation from highly efficient ankle muscle-tendons to less efficient hip muscle-tendons. A within and across limb redistribution of mechanical workload represents a potential mechanism for increased metabolic demand in pathological populations with plantarflexion deficits or those that walk with an ankle--foot orthosis that restricts range of motion.},

Two inertial sensors were attached at the midpoint of each shank to measure the accelerations and angular velocity during walking. Despite the abnormalities in hemiparetic gait, the angular velocity of most of the testing subjects (12 out of 13) exhibited similar characteristics as those from a healthy population, enabling walking speed estimation and gait event detection based on the pendulum walking model. The results from a standardized 10-meter walk test demonstrated that the IMU-based method has an excellent agreement with the clinically used stopwatch method. The gait symmetry results were comparable with previous studies. The gait segmentation failed when the angular velocity deviates significantly from the healthy groups' profile. With further development and concurrent validations, the inertial sensor-based system may eventually become a useful tool for continually monitoring spatio-temporal gait parameters post stroke in a natural environment.},

  abstract = {Measuring biomechanical work performed by humans and other animals is critical for understanding muscle--tendon function, jointspecific contributions and energy-saving mechanisms during locomotion. Inverse dynamics is often employed to estimate jointlevel contributions, and deformable body estimates can be used to study work performed by the foot. We recently discovered that these commonly used experimental estimates fail to explain whole-body energy changes observed during human walking. By re-analyzing previously published data, we found that about 25\% (8 J) of total positive energy changes of/about the body's center-of-mass and {$>$}30\% of the energy changes during the Push-off phase of walking were not explained by conventional joint- and segment-level work estimates, exposing a gap in our fundamental understanding of work production during gait. Here, we present a novel Energy-Accounting analysis that integrates various empirical measures of work and energy to elucidate the source of unexplained biomechanical work. We discovered that by extending conventional 3 degree-of-freedom (DOF) inverse dynamics (estimating rotational work about joints) to 6DOF (rotational and translational) analysis of the hip, knee, ankle and foot, we could fully explain the missing positive work. This revealed that Push-off work performed about the hip may be {$>$}50\% greater than conventionally estimated (9.3 versus 6.0 J, P=0.0002, at 1.4 m s-1). Our findings demonstrate that 6DOF analysis (of hip--knee--ankle--foot) better captures energy changes of the body than more conventional 3DOF estimates. These findings refine our fundamental understanding of how work is distributed within the body, which has implications for assistive technology, biomechanical simulations and potentially clinical treatment.},

  abstract = {Muscle--tendon units about the ankle joint generate a burst of positive power during the step-to-step transition in human walking, termed ankle push-off, but there is no scientific consensus on its functional role. A central question embodied in the biomechanics literature is: does ankle push-off primarily contribute to leg swing, or to center of mass (COM) acceleration? This question has been debated in various forms for decades. However, it actually presents a false dichotomy, as these two possibilities are not mutually exclusive. If we ask either question independently, the answer is the same: yes! (1) Does ankle push-off primarily contribute to leg swing acceleration? Yes. (2) Does ankle push-off primarily contribute to COM acceleration? Yes. Here, we summarize the historical debate, then synthesize the seemingly polarized perspectives and demonstrate that both descriptions are valid. The principal means by which ankle push-off affects COM mechanics is by a localized action that increases the speed and kinetic energy of the trailing push-off limb. Because the limb is included in body COM computations, this localized segmental acceleration also accelerates the COM, and most of the segmental energy change also appears as COM energy change. Interpretation of ankle mechanics should abandon an either/or contrast of leg swing versus COM acceleration. Instead, ankle push-off should be interpreted in light of both mutually consistent effects. This unified perspective informs our fundamental understanding of the role of ankle push-off, and has important implications for the design of clinical interventions (e.g. prostheses, orthoses) intended to restore locomotor function to individuals with disabilities.},

  abstract = {Gait asymmetry is an important marker of mobility impairment post stroke. This study proposes a new gait symmetry index (GSI) to quantify gait symmetry with one 3D accelerometer at L3 (GSIL3). GSIL3 was evaluated with 16 post stroke patients and nine healthy controls in the Six-Minute-Walk-Test (6-MWT). Discriminative power was evaluated with Wilcoxon test and the effect size (ES) was computed with Cliff's Delta. GSIL3 estimated during the entire 6-MWT and during a short segment straight walk (GSIL3straight) have comparable effect size to one another (ES = 0.89, p {$<$} 0.001) and to the symmetry indices derived from feet sensors (\textbar ES\textbar{} = [0.22, 0.89]). Furthermore, while none of the indices derived from feet sensors showed significant differences between post stroke patients walking with a cane compared to those able to walk without, GSIL3 was able to discriminate between these two groups with a significantly lower value in the group using a cane (ES = 0.70, p = 0.02). In addition, GSIL3 was strongly associated with several symmetry indices measured by feet sensors during the straight walking cycles (Spearman correlation: \textbar{$\rho\vert$} = [0.82, 0.88], p {$<$} 0.05). The proposed index can be a reliable and cost-efficient post stroke gait symmetry assessment with implications for research and clinical practice.},

  abstract = {Context: An effective application of biofeedback for interventions in older adults with balance and mobility disorders may be compromised due to co-morbidity. Objective: To evaluate the feasibility and the effectiveness of biofeedback-based training of balance and/or mobility in older adults. Data Sources: PubMed (1950-2009), EMBASE (1988-2009), Web of Science (1945-2009), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (1960-2009), CINAHL (1982-2009) and PsycINFO (1840-2009). The search strategy was composed of terms referring to biofeedback, balance or mobility, and older adults. Additional studies were identified by scanning reference lists. Study Selection: For evaluating effectiveness, 2 reviewers independently screened papers and included controlled studies in older adults (i.e. mean age equal to or greater than 60 years) if they applied biofeedback during repeated practice sessions, and if they used at least one objective outcome measure of a balance or mobility task. Data Extraction: Rating of study quality, with use of the Physiotherapy Evidence Database rating scale (PEDro scale), was performed independently by the 2 reviewers. Indications for (non)effectiveness were identified if 2 or more similar studies reported a (non)significant effect for the same type of outcome. Effect sizes were calculated. Results and Conclusions: Although most available studies did not systematically evaluate feasibility aspects, reports of high participation rates, low drop-out rates, absence of adverse events and positive training experiences suggest that biofeedback methods can be applied in older adults. Effectiveness was evaluated based on 21 studies, mostly of moderate quality. An indication for effectiveness of visual feedback-based training of balance in (frail) older adults was identified for postural sway, weight-shifting and reaction time in standing, and for the Berg Balance Scale. Indications for added effectiveness of applying biofeedback during training of balance, gait, or sit-tostand transfers in older patients post-stroke were identified for training-specific aspects. The same applies for auditory feedback-based training of gait in older patients with lower-limb surgery. Implications: Further appropriate studies are needed in different populations of older adults to be able to make definitive statements regarding the (long-term) added effectiveness, particularly on measures of functioning.},
