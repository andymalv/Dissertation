  abstract = {In this work, we develop a novel gait phase detection algorithm based on a hidden Markov model, which uses data from foot-mounted single-axis gyroscopes as input. We explore whether the proposed gait detection algorithm can generate equivalent results as a reference signal provided by force sensitive resistors (FSRs) for typically developing children (TD) and children with hemiplegia (HC). We find that the algorithm faithfully reproduces reference results in terms of high values of sensitivity and specificity with respect to FSR signals. In addition, the algorithm distinguishes between TD and HC and is able to assess the level of gait ability in patients. Finally, we show that the algorithm can be adapted to enable real-time processing with high accuracy. Due to the small, inexpensive nature of gyroscopes utilized in this study and the ease of implementation of the developed algorithm, this work finds application in the on-going development of active orthoses designed for therapy and locomotion in children with gait pathologies.},

  abstract = {Simple dynamic walking models based on the inverted pendulum predict that the human body's center of mass (COM) moves along an arc during each step, with substantial work performed to redirect the COM velocity in the step-to-step transition between arcs. But humans do not keep the stance leg perfectly straight and need not redirect their COM velocity precisely as predicted. We therefore tested a pendulum-based model against a wide range of human walking data. We examined COM velocity and work data from normal human subjects (N=10) walking at 24 combinations of speed (0.75 to 2.0 m s--1) and step length. These were compared against model predictions for the angular redirection of COM velocity and the work performed on the COM during redirection. We found that the COM is redirected through angular changes increasing approximately linearly with step length (R2=0.68), with COM work increasing with the squared product of walking speed and step length (R2=0.82), roughly in accordance with a simple dynamic walking model. This model cannot, however, predict the duration of COM redirection, which we quantified with two empirical measures, one based on angular COM redirection and the other on work. Both indicate that the step-to-step transition begins before and ends after double support and lasts about twice as long -- approximately 20--27\% of a stride. Although a rigid leg model can predict trends in COM velocity and work, the non-rigid human leg performs the step-to-step transition over a duration considerably exceeding that of double support.},

As rehabilitative evidence and surgical technology and procedures have progressed, the original guidelines should be revisited to ensure that the most up-to-date evidence is guiding rehabilitative care. Emerging evidence on rehabilitative interventions and advancements in concomitant surgeries, including those addressing chondral and meniscal injuries, continues to grow and greatly affect the rehabilitative care of patients with anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. The aim of this article is to update previously published rehabilitation guidelines, using the most recent research to reflect the most current evidence for management of patients after anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.

Here we review the evidence that the corticospinal system is not only plastic but that the nature and locus of this plasticity is dictated by the specifics of the motor experience. Skill training induces synaptogenesis, synaptic potentiation, and reorganization of movement representations within motor cortex. Endurance training induces angiogenesis in motor cortex, but it does not alter motor map organization or synapse number. Strength training alters spinal motoneuron excitability and induces synaptogenesis within spinal cord, but it does not alter motor map organization. All three training experiences induce changes in spinal reflexes that are dependent on the specific behavioral demands of the task. These results demonstrate that the acquisition of skilled movement induces a reorganization of neural circuitry within motor cortex that supports the production and refinement of skilled movement sequences. We present data that suggest increases in strength may be mediated by an increased capacity for activation and/or recruitment of spinal motoneurons while the increased metabolic demands associated with endurance training induce cortical angiogenesis. Together these results show the robust pattern of anatomic and physiological plasticity that occurs within the corticospinal system in response to differential motor experience.

Demographic and clinical data were extracted from patient charts. Diagnosis of MTD was confirmed with videostroboscopic and physical exam and by a speech-language pathologist. Eighteen MTD patients were video recorded while at rest and with phonation. Five patients without MTD also were analyzed as controls. Videos were analyzed using Eulerian Video Magnification software (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) to assess change in blood flow at the forehead, infrahyoid muscles, and sternocleidomastoid muscles, while using the values of the background wall as a control value. Results. Patients with MTD demonstrated little change in perfusion to the infrahyoid muscles of the neck while phonating (+1\% {\S} 55\%). Control subjects demonstrated an increase in perfusion to the infrahyoid muscles while phonating (+102\% {\S} 164\%), with this change being significant when comparing the two groups (P = 0.04, t = 2.189, df = 21). A change in perfusion of 0\% or less to infrahyoid muscles was 75\% sensitive and 70\% specific for diagnosis of MTD. No differences in perfusion were found between other regions assessed. Patient age and gender did not correlate with any change in perfusion between rest and phonation. Conclusion. Our data suggest that Eulerian Video Magnification can be used in the diagnosis of MTD by focusing on the difference in perfusion to the infrahyoid muscles between rest and phonation.},

However, the application of vibrotactile biofeedback coding schemes to gait symmetry training is not well explored. In this paper, we devised various vibrotactile biofeedback modes and identified their efficacy during gait symmetry training of individuals suffering from hemiparesis due to stroke. These modes are composed of variations in vibration type (on-time or intensity), and relation type (proportional or inversely-proportional) with the error in symmetry ratio. Eight individuals with stroke participated in walking trials. From dependent t-tests on the collected data, we found improved achievement of temporal gait symmetry while utilizing all the provided biofeedback modes compared to no biofeedback (P {$<$}; 0.001). Furthermore, two-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed statistically significant difference in symmetry ratio for main effect of vibration type (P-value = 0.016, partial eta squared = 0.585). The participants performed better with modes of biofeedback with varying vibration on-times. Furthermore, participants showed better performance when the biofeedback varied proportionally with the error. These findings suggest that biofeedback coding schemes may have a significant effect on the performance of gait training.},

However, most of these technologies are expensive, can only be used in laboratory environments, and examine only a few trials of each movement action. In this paper, we present a novel ambulatory motion analysis framework using wearable inertial sensors to accurately assess all of an athlete's activities in real training environment. We first present a system that automatically classifies a large range of training activities using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) in conjunction with a random forest classifier. The classifier is capable of successfully classifying various activities with up to 98\% accuracy. Second, a computationally efficient gradient descent algorithm is used to estimate the relative orientations of the wearable inertial sensors mounted on the shank, thigh, and pelvis of a subject, from which the flexion-extension knee and hip angles are calculated. These angles, along with sacrum impact accelerations, are automatically extracted for each stride during jogging. Finally, normative data are generated and used to determine if a subject's movement technique differed to the normative data in order to identify potential injury-related factors. For the joint angle data, this is achieved using a curve-shift registration technique. It is envisaged that the proposed framework could be utilized for accurate and automatic sports activity classification and reliable movement technique evaluation in various unconstrained environments for both injury management and performance enhancement.},

Targets were shown to indicate to the subject when to activate the monitored muscles. Gait evaluations were performed before and after the training period to test the hypothesis that ankle mechanics improved following the intervention. Improvements in gait function were characterized by changes in temporal gait parameters and lower extremity kinematics and kinetics. Subjects showed an increase in gait speed, time of single leg support on the affected side, ankle power generation at push-off and a reduction in knee extensor moment.

Stroke patients have a high potential to develop dementia within the first year of stroke onset. Currently, efforts are being exerted to assess stroke effects on the brain, particularly in the early stages. Numerous neuropsychological assessments are being used to evaluate and differentiate cognitive impairment and dementia following stroke. This article focuses on the role of available neuropsychological assessments in detection of dementia and memory loss after stroke. This review starts with stroke types and risk factors associated with dementia development, followed by a brief description of stroke diagnosis criteria and the effects of stroke on the brain that lead to cognitive impairment and end with memory loss. This review aims to combine available neuropsychological assessments to develop a post-stroke memory assessment (PSMA) scheme based on the most recognized and available studies. The proposed PSMA is expected to assess different types of memory functionalities that are related to different parts of the brain according to stroke location. An optimal therapeutic program that would help stroke patients enjoy additional years with higher quality of life is presented.},

The study involved the discrimination of gait patterns of healthy, cerebral palsy (CP) and multiple sclerosis subjects. The acquired 3D GRFs data were categorized into three groups. Two different algorithms were used to extract the gait features; the GRFs parameters and the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), respectively. Nearest neighbor classifier (NNC) and artificial neural networks (ANN) were also investigated for the classification of gait features in this study. Furthermore, different feature sets were formed using a combination of the 3D GRFs components (mediolateral, anterioposterior, and vertical) and their various impacts on the acquired results were evaluated. The best leave-one-out (LOO) classification accuracy 85\% was achieved. The results showed some improvement through the application of a features selection algorithm based on M-shaped value of vertical force and the statistical test ANOVA of mediolateral and anterioposterior forces. The optimal feature set of six features enhanced the accuracy to 95\%.

Studies in neurologically intact subjects suggest that the gradual presentation of small perturbations (errors) during learning results in better transfer of a newly learned walking pattern to overground walking. Whether the same result would be true after stroke is not known. Objective. To determine whether introducing gradual perturbations, during locomotor learning using a split-belt treadmill influences learning the novel walking pattern or transfer to overground walking poststroke. Methods. Twenty-six chronic stroke survivors participated and completed the following walking testing paradigm: baseline overground walking; baseline treadmill walking; split-belt treadmill/adaptation period (belts moving at different speeds); catch trial (belts at same speed); post overground walking. Subjects were randomly assigned to the Gradual group (gradual changes in treadmill belts speed during adaptation) or the Abrupt group (a single, large, abrupt change during adaptation). Step length asymmetry adaptation response on the treadmill and transfer of learning to overground walking was assessed. Results. Step length asymmetry during the catch trial was the same between groups (P = .195) confirming that both groups learned a similar amount. The magnitude of transfer to overground walking was greater in the Gradual than in the Abrupt group (P = .041). Conclusions. The introduction of gradual perturbations (small errors), compared with abrupt (larger errors), during a locomotor adaptation task seems to improve transfer of the newly learned walking pattern to overground walking poststroke. However, given the limited magnitude of transfer, future studies should examine other factors that could impact locomotor learning and transfer poststroke.},

The goal of this study was to determine if post-stroke hemiparetic subjects grouped by step length asymmetry have similar abnormal walking biomechanics compared to non-impaired walkers. Kinematic and ground reaction force data were recorded from 55 hemiparetic subjects walking at their self-selected speed and 21 age and speed-matched non-impaired control subjects. Hemiparetic subjects were grouped by paretic step ratio, which was calculated as the paretic step-length divided by the sum of paretic and nonparetic step-lengths, into high ({$>$}0.535), symmetric (0.535-0.465) and low ({$<$}0.465) groups. Non-parametric Wilcoxin signed-rank tests were used to test for differences in joint kinetic measures between hemiparetic groups and speed-matched control subjects during late single-leg stance and pre-swing. The paretic leg ankle moment impulse was reduced in all hemiparetic subjects regardless of their paretic step ratio. The high group had increased nonparetic leg ankle plantarflexor and knee extensor moment impulses, the symmetric group had increased hip flexor moment impulses on both the paretic and nonparetic leg and the low group had no additional significant differences in joint moment impulses. These results suggest that the direction of asymmetry can be used to identify both the degree of paretic plantarflexor impairment and the compensatory mechanisms used by post-stroke hemiparetic subjects. {\copyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Our results also suggest that inducing more appropriate (i.e., reduced) ankle plantar/dorsi-flexor muscle coactivation may be an important neuromuscular mechanism underlying improvements in gait function after FastFES training, suggesting that pre-treatment ankle muscle status could be used for inclusion into FastFES. The findings of this case-series study, albeit preliminary, provide the rationale and foundations for larger-sample studies using similar methodology.},

  abstract = {The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is a critical part of normal knee function. With as many as 250,000 injuries every year, most of which occurthrough little or no contact, ACL reconstruction and rehabilitation are extremely important and relevant topics. One way to test a patient's rehabilitation from ACL reconstruction is through the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT). A subject's reach distance in the SEBT can be determined using motion capture systems. However, state of the art motion capture systems present some difficulties, such as cost and complexity of use. The Microsoft Kinect{\copyright}, an inexpensive, markerless motion capture system, was predicted to solve the issues facing modern motion capture systems, while portraying acceptable levels of accuracy. It was also predicted that subjects who had undergone ACL reconstruction within the previous three months would not perform as well as controls in the SEBT. It was concluded that in most directions of the SEBT, the Kinect{\copyright} performed within an acceptable range for use by clinicians in determining a patient's advancement through rehabilitation. It was also concluded that the pathological subjects did not perform as well as controls. Future directions for this study include testing more pathological subjects and controls, as well as determining ways to capture more difficult directions of the SEBT.},

  abstract = {In this study we describe an ambulatory system for estimation of spatio-temporal parameters during long periods of walking. This original method based on wavelet analysis is proposed to compute the values of temporal gait parameters from the angular velocity of lower limbs. Based on a mechanical model, the medio-lateral rotation of the lower limbs during stance and swing, the stride length and velocity are estimated by integration of the angular velocity. Measurement's accuracy was assessed using as a criterion standard the information provided by foot pressure sensors. To assess the accuracy of the method on a broad range of performance for each gait parameter, we gathered data from young and elderly subjects. No significant error was observed for toe-off detection, while a slight systematic delay (10 ms on average) existed between heelstrike obtained from gyroscopes and footswitch. There was no significant difference between actual spatial parameters (stride length and velocity) and their estimated values. Errors for velocity and stride length estimations were 0.06 m/s and 0.07 m, respectively. This system is light, portable, inexpensive and does not provoke any discomfort to subjects. It can be carried for long periods of time, thus providing new longitudinal information such as stride-tostride variability of gait. Several clinical applications can be proposed such as outcome evaluation after total knee or hip replacement, external prosthesis adjustment for amputees, monitoring of rehabilitation progress, gait analysis in neurological diseases, and fall risk estimation in elderly. r 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

One possible approach involves estimating the ground reaction forces from kinematic data obtained by inertial measurement units (IMUs) worn by the subject. As estimating kinetic quantities from kinematic data is not an easy task, several models and protocols have been developed over the years. Non-wearable sensors, such as optoelectronic systems along with force platforms, remain the most accurate systems to record motion. In this review, we identified, selected and categorized the methodologies for estimating the ground reaction forces from IMUs as proposed across the years. Scopus, Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed databases were interrogated on the topic of Ground Reaction Forces estimation based on kinematic data obtained by IMUs. The identified papers were classified according to the methodology proposed: (i) methods based on direct modelling; (ii) methods based on machine learning. The methods based on direct modelling were further classified according to the task studied (walking, running, jumping, etc.). Finally, we comparatively examined the methods in order to identify the most reliable approaches for the implementation of a ground reaction force estimator based on IMU data.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The system, which increases the stance phase time of the affected leg and then realizes a well-balanced gait, is divided into two components. First, the stance phase of the unaffected (``sound'') and affected legs is measured and presented visually in real time to the patient and physical therapist as biofeedback. Second, using the biofeedback of the stance phase, the physical therapist sets two different velocities of the treadmill belts for the sound and affected legs. In an experiment, eleven patients with chronic stroke participated in a short-term intervention trial (twenty gait cycles) of the developed treadmill system. Three of the five subjects who had lost balance between the stance phase of the sound leg and that of the affected one improved their gait balance in the intervention trial. In addition, one subject kept the well-balanced gait after the intervention. In the future, the algorithm to automatically adjust the belt velocities of the affected and sound sides and better biofeedback system with the sound leg information will be developed.},

  abstract = {Humans and animals walk adaptively in diverse situations by skillfully manipulating their complicated and redundant musculoskeletal systems. From an analysis of measured electromyographic (EMG) data, it appears that despite complicated spatiotemporal properties, muscle activation patterns can be explained by a low dimensional spatiotemporal structure. More specifically, they can be accounted for by the combination of a small number of basic activation patterns. The basic patterns and distribution weights indicate temporal and spatial structures, respectively, and the weights show the muscle sets that are activated synchronously. In addition, various locomotor behaviors have similar low dimensional structures and major differences appear in the basic patterns. These analysis results suggest that neural systems use muscle group combinations to solve motor control redundancy problems (muscle synergy hypothesis) and manipulate those basic patterns to create various locomotor functions. However, it remains unclear how the neural system controls such muscle groups and basic patterns through neuromechanical interactions in order to achieve adaptive locomotor behavior. This paper reviews simulation studies that explored adaptive motor control in locomotion via sensory-motor coordination using neuromusculoskeletal models based on the muscle synergy hypothesis. Herein, the neural mechanism in motor control related to the muscle synergy for adaptive locomotion and a potential muscle synergy analysis method including neuromusculoskeletal modeling for motor impairments and rehabilitation are discussed.},

The ACL is made up of multiple collagen bundles that give rise to the multifascicular nature of the ligament. This arrangement results in a different portion of the ligament being taut and therefore functional, throughout the range of motion. The ACL receives its blood supply from branches of the middle genicular artery, which from a vascular synovial envelope around the ligament. These periligamentous vessels penetrate the ligament transversely and anastomose with a longitudinal network of endoligamentous vessels. The body attachments do not contribute significantly to the vascularity of the ligament. The nerve supply to the ACL originates from the tibial nerve. Although the majority of fibers appear to have a vasomotor function, some fibers may serve a proprioceptive or sensory function.},

However, difficulties lie in signal variability and interpretation in relation to biomechanical events. In walking, heel strike and toe off are primary gait events where robust and accurate detection is essential for gait-related applications. This paper describes a novel and generic event detection algorithm applicable to signals from tri-axial accelerometers placed on the foot, ankle, shank or waist. Data from healthy subjects undergoing multiple walking trials on flat and inclined, as well as smooth and tactile paving surfaces is acquired for experimentation. The benchmark timings at which heel strike and toe off occur, are determined using kinematic data recorded from a motion capture system. The algorithm extracts features from each of the acceleration signals using a continuous wavelet transform over a wide range of scales. A locality preserving embedding method is then applied to reduce the high dimensionality caused by the multiple scales while preserving salient features for classification. A simple Gaussian mixture model is then trained to classify each of the time samples into heel strike, toe off or no event categories. Results show good detection and temporal accuracies for different sensor locations and different walking terrains.},

  abstract = {Advances in medical diagnosis and treatment have facilitated the emergence of precision medicine. In contrast, locomotor rehabilitation for individuals with acquired neuromotor injuries remains limited by the dearth of (i) diagnostic approaches that can identify the specific neuromuscular, biomechanical, and clinical impairments underlying deficits in the subtasks of locomotion and (ii) evidence-based, targeted treatments. In particular, impaired propulsion by the paretic limb is a major contributor to walking-related disability after stroke; however, few interventions have been able to target deficits in propulsion effectively and in a manner that reduces walking disability. Indeed, the weakness and impaired control that is characteristic of post-stroke hemiparesis leads to heterogeneous deficits that impair paretic propulsion and contribute to a slow, metabolically-expensive, and unstable gait. Current rehabilitation paradigms emphasize the rapid attainment of walking independence, not the restoration of normal propulsion function. Although walking independence is an important goal for stroke survivors, independence achieved via compensatory strategies may prevent the recovery of propulsion needed for the fast, economical, and stable gait that is characteristic of healthy bipedal locomotion. We posit that post-stroke rehabilitation should aim to promote independent walking, in part, through the acquisition of enhanced propulsion. In this expert review, we present the biomechanical and clinical consequences of post-stroke propulsion deficits, review advances in our understanding of the nature of post-stroke propulsion impairment, and discuss emerging diagnostic and treatment approaches that have the potential to facilitate new rehabilitation paradigms targeting propulsion restoration.},

Design Single group pre-post preliminary study investigating a novel locomotor intervention. Setting Research laboratory. Participants Individuals (N=13) with locomotor deficits after stroke. Intervention FastFES training was provided for 12 weeks at a frequency of 3 sessions per week and 30 minutes per session. Main Outcome Measures Measures of gait mechanics, functional balance, short- and long-distance walking function, and self-perceived participation were collected at baseline, posttraining, and 3-month follow-up evaluations. Changes after treatment were assessed using pairwise comparisons and compared with known minimal clinically important differences or minimal detectable changes. Correlation analyses were run to determine the correlation between baseline clinical and biomechanical performance versus improvements in walking speed. Results Twelve of the 13 subjects that were recruited completed the training. Improvements in paretic propulsion were accompanied by improvements in functional balance, walking function, and self-perceived participation (each P{$<$}.02) - all of which were maintained at 3-month follow-up. Eleven of the 12 subjects achieved meaningful functional improvements. Baseline impairment was predictive of absolute, but not relative, functional change after training.

Objectives. To determine the relative contribution of variables from 3 biomechanical constructs to poststroke long-distance walking function and identify the biomechanical changes underlying posttraining improvements in long-distance walking function. Methods. Forty-four individuals {$>$}6 months after stroke participated in this study. A subset of these subjects (n = 31) underwent 12 weeks of high-intensity locomotor training. Cross-sectional (pretraining) and longitudinal (posttraining change) regression quantified the relationships between poststroke long-distance walking function, as measured via the 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), and walking biomechanics. Biomechanical variables were organized into stance phase (paretic propulsion and trailing limb angle), swing phase (paretic ankle dorsiflexion and knee flexion), and symmetry (step length and swing time) constructs. Results. Pretraining, all variables correlated with 6MWT distance (rs = .39 to .75, Ps {$<$} .05); however, only propulsion (Prop) and trailing limb angle (TLA) independently predicted 6MWT distance, R2 = .655, F(6, 36) = 11.38, P {$<$} .001. Interestingly, only {$\Delta$}Prop predicted {$\Delta$}6MWT; however, pretraining Prop, pretraining TLA, and {$\Delta$}TLA moderated this relationship (moderation model R2s = .383, .468, .289, respectively). Conclusions. The paretic limb's ability to generate propulsion during walking is a critical determinant of long-distance walking function after stroke. This finding supports the development of poststroke interventions that target deficits in propulsion and trailing limb angle.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A higher energy cost of walking poststroke has been linked to reduced walking performance and reduced participation in the community. OBJECTIVE: To determine the contribution of postintervention improvements in walking speed and spatiotemporal gait asymmetry to the reduction in the energy cost of walking after stroke. METHODS: In all, 42 individuals with chronic hemiparesis ({$>$}6 months poststroke) were recruited to participate in 12 weeks of walking rehabilitation. The energy cost of walking, walking speed, and step length, swing time, and stance time asymmetries were calculated pretraining and posttraining. Sequential regression analyses tested the cross-sectional (ie, pretraining) and longitudinal (ie, posttraining changes) relationships between the energy cost of walking versus speed and each measure of asymmetry. RESULTS: Pretraining walking speed ({$\beta$} = -.506) and swing time asymmetry ({$\beta$} = .403) predicted pretraining energy costs: adj R (2) = 0.713; F(3, 37) = 34.05; P {$<$} .001. In contrast, change in walking speed ({$\beta$} = .340) and change in step length asymmetry ({$\beta$} = .934) predicted change in energy costs with a significant interaction between these independent predictors: adj R (2) = 0.699; F(4, 31) = 21.326; P {$<$} .001. Moderation by the direction or the magnitude of pretraining asymmetry was not found. CONCLUSIONS: For persons in the chronic phase of stroke recovery, faster and more symmetric walking after intervention appears to be more energetically advantageous than merely walking faster or more symmetrically. This finding has important functional implications, given the relationship between the energy cost of walking and community walking participation.},

Recent work has demonstrated proof-of-concept for a functional electrical stimulation (FES)--based combination therapy designed to improve poststroke walking by targeting deficits in paretic propulsion. Objectives. To determine the effects on the energy cost of walking (EC) and long-distance walking ability of locomotor training that combines fast walking with FES to the paretic ankle musculature (FastFES). Methods. Fifty participants {$>$}6 months poststroke were randomized to 12 weeks of gait training at self-selected speeds (SS), fast speeds (Fast), or FastFES. Participants' 6-minute walk test (6MWT) distance and EC at comfortable (EC-CWS) and fast (EC-Fast) walking speeds were measured pretraining, posttraining, and at a 3-month follow-up. A reduction in EC-CWS, independent of changes in speed, was the primary outcome. Group differences in the number of 6MWT responders and moderation by baseline speed were also evaluated. Results. When compared with SS and Fast, FastFES produced larger reductions in EC (Ps {$\leq$}.03). FastFES produced reductions of 24\% and 19\% in EC-CWS and EC-Fast (Ps {$<$}.001), respectively, whereas neither Fast nor SS influenced EC. Between-group 6MWT differences were not observed; however, 73\% of FastFES and 68\% of Fast participants were responders, in contrast to 35\% of SS participants. Conclusions. Combining fast locomotor training with FES is an effective approach to reducing the high EC of persons poststroke. Surprisingly, differences in 6MWT gains were not observed between groups. Closer inspection of the 6MWT and EC relationship and elucidation of how reduced EC may influence walking-related disability is warranted.},

  abstract = {Stroke-induced hemiparetic gait is characteristically slow and metabolically expensive. Passive assistive devices such as ankle-foot orthoses are often prescribed to increase function and independence after stroke; however, walking remains highly impaired despite---and perhaps because of---their use. We sought to determine whether a soft wearable robot (exosuit) designed to supplement the paretic limb's residual ability to generate both forward propulsion and ground clearance could facilitate more normal walking after stroke. Exosuits transmit mechanical power generated by actuators to a wearer through the interaction of garment-like, functional textile anchors and cable-based transmissions. We evaluated the immediate effects of an exosuit actively assisting the paretic limb of individuals in the chronic phase of stroke recovery during treadmill and overground walking. Using controlled, treadmill-based biomechanical investigation, we demonstrate that exosuits can function in synchrony with a wearer's paretic limb to facilitate an immediate 5.33 {\textpm} 0.91{$^\circ$} increase in the paretic ankle's swing phase dorsiflexion and 11 {\textpm} 3\% increase in the paretic limb's generation of forward propulsion (P {$<$} 0.05). These improvements in paretic limb function contributed to a 20 {\textpm} 4\% reduction in forward propulsion interlimb asymmetry and a 10 {\textpm} 3\% reduc- tion in the energy cost of walking, which is equivalent to a 32 {\textpm} 9\% reduction in the metabolic burden associated with poststroke walking. Relatively low assistance ({\textasciitilde}12\% of biological torques) delivered with a lightweight and nonrestrictive exosuit was sufficient to facilitate more normal walking in ambulatory individuals after stroke. Future work will focus on understanding how exosuit-induced improvements in walking performance may be leveraged to improve mobility after stroke.},

  abstract = {Objective: The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects on common poststroke gait compensations of a soft wearable robot (exosuit) designed to assist the paretic limb during hemiparetic walking. Design: A single-session study of eight individuals in the chronic phase of stroke recovery was conducted. Two testing conditions were compared: walking with the exosuit powered versus walking with the exosuit unpowered. Each condition was 8 minutes in duration. Results: Compared with walking with the exosuit unpowered, walking with the exosuit powered resulted in reductions in hip hiking (27 [6\%], P = 0.004) and circumduction (20 [5\%], P = 0.004). A relationship between changes in knee flexion and changes in hip hiking was observed (Pearson r = -0.913, P {$<$} 0.001). Similarly, multivariate regression revealed that changes in knee flexion ([beta] = -0.912, P = 0.007), but not ankle dorsiflexion ([beta] = -0.194, P = 0.341), independently predicted changes in hip hiking (R2 = 0.87, F(2, 4) = 13.48, P = 0.017). Conclusions: Exosuit assistance of the paretic limb during walking produces immediate changes in the kinematic strategy used to advance the paretic limb. Future work is necessary to determine how exosuit-induced reductions in paretic hip hiking and circumduction during gait training could be leveraged to facilitate more normal walking behavior during unassisted walking.

  abstract = {For effective gait rehabilitation treatments, the status of a patient's gait needs to be analyzed precisely. Since the gait motions are cyclic with several gait phases, the gait motions can be analyzed by gait phases. In this paper, a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is applied to analyze the gait phases in the gait motions. Smart Shoes are utilized to obtain the ground reaction forces (GRFs) as observed data in the HMM. The posterior probabilities from the HMM are used to infer the gait phases, and the abnormal transition between gait phases are checked by the transition matrix. The proposed gait phase analysis methods have been applied to actual gait data, and the results show that the proposed methods have the potential of tools for diagnosing the status of a patient and evaluating a rehabilitation treatment.},

  abstract = {Stroke-induced hemiparetic gait is characteristically asymmetric and metabolically expensive. Weakness and impaired control of the paretic ankle contribute to reduced forward propulsion and ground clearance -- walking subtasks critical for safe and efficient locomotion. Targeted gait interventions that improve paretic ankle function after stroke are therefore warranted. We have developed textile-based, soft wearable robots that transmit mechanical power generated by offboard or body-worn actuators to the paretic ankle using Bowden cables (soft exosuits) and have demonstrated the exosuits can overcome deficits in paretic limb forward propulsion and ground clearance, ultimately reducing the metabolic cost of hemiparetic walking. This study elucidates the biomechanical mechanisms underlying exosuit-induced reductions in metabolic power. We evaluated the relationships between exosuit-induced changes in the body center of mass (COM) power generated by each limb, individual joint power and metabolic power. Compared with walking with an exosuit unpowered, exosuit assistance produced more symmetrical COM power generation during the critical period of the step-to-step transition (22.4{\textpm}6.4\% more symmetric). Changes in individual limb COM power were related to changes in paretic (R2=0.83, P=0.004) and non-paretic (R2=0.73, P=0.014) ankle power. Interestingly, despite the exosuit providing direct assistance to only the paretic limb, changes in metabolic power were related to changes in non-paretic limb COM power (R2=0.80, P=0.007), not paretic limb COM power (P{$>$}0.05). These findings contribute to a fundamental understanding of how individuals post-stroke interact with an exosuit to reduce the metabolic cost of hemiparetic walking.},

  abstract = {Hemiparetic gait after stroke is typically asymmetric and energetically inefficient. A major contributor to walking deficits is impaired paretic ankle function. Impaired paretic ankle plantarflexion (PF) reduces forward propulsion symmetry and impaired paretic ankle dorsiflexion (DF) diminishes ground clearance during swing. We have developed soft wearable robots (soft exosuits) to assist paretic PF and DF during walking after stroke. Through experimental studies with poststroke patients, we have demonstrated that exosuits can improve forward propulsion symmetry and ground clearance in walking, ultimately reducing the metabolic cost of walking. This paper presents an optimized soft exosuit aimed at use in clinical gait training for patients poststroke. The optimized exosuit is lightweight, easy to don and doff, and capable of efficiently delivering mechanical assistance to the paretic ankle. This paper focuses on the optimized controller that can deliver well-timed consistent ankle assistance to patients. A preliminary study was performed using this exosuit with three poststroke patients with heterogeneous gait patterns. Results showed that compared to a previously published controller, more consistent assistive force profiles could be delivered to individuals poststroke while consuming 50\% less electrical power. Additionally, a preliminary biomechanical assessment was performed during overground walking.},

The Euler angles are sent via Bluetooth protocols to a pc for calculating the knee joint angle. In our experiments, we utilized a motion capture system to accurately measure the knee joint angle and used this as the ground truth to assess the accuracy of the IMU system. The range of average error of the system across a variety of motion trials was 0.08 to 3.06 degrees. In summary, the accuracy of the IMU measurement system currently outperforms existing wearable systems such as conductive fiber optic sensors and flex-sensors.},

The goals of this study were to identify the onset and the prevalence of frailty across the lifespan and to determine if a frailty phenotype predicts mortality. Body weight, walking speed, strength, endurance and physical activity were assessed in male C57BL/6 mice every three months starting at 14 months of age. Mice that fell in the bottom 20\% for walking speed, strength, endurance and physical activity, and in the top 20\% for body weight were considered to have a positive frailty marker. The onset of frailty occurred at 17 months, and represented only 3.5\% of the mouse cohort. The percentage of frail mice increased with age until basically every mouse was identified as frail. Frail, pre-frail, and non-frail mice had mean survival ages of 27, 29 and 34 months, respectively. In closing, frail mice lack resilience; in that, multiple tissue/organ systems may deteriorate at an accelerated rate and ultimately lead to early mortality when compared to non-frail mice. Identifying the onset and prevalence of frailty, in addition to predicting mortality, has potential to yield information about several aging processes.},

Altogether, 24 gait features describing the three types of gait characteristics were extracted for developing gait recognition models and later testing of generalization performance. Test results indicated an overall accuracy of 91.7\% by the SVM in its capacity to distinguish the two gait patterns. The classification ability of the SVM was found to be unaffected across six kernel functions (linear, polynomial, radial basis, exponential radial basis, multi-layer perceptron and spline). Gait recognition rate improved when features were selected from different gait data type. A feature selection algorithm demonstrated that as little as three gait features, one selected from each data type, could effectively distinguish the age groups with 100\% accuracy.

  abstract = {Ageing influences gait patterns causing constant threats to control of locomotor balance. Automated recognition of gait changes has many advantages including, early identification of at-risk gait and monitoring the progress of treatment outcomes. In this paper, we apply an artificial intelligence technique [support vector machines (SVM)] for the automatic recognition of young-old gait types from their respective gait-patterns. Minimum foot clearance (MFC) data of 30 young and 28 elderly participants were analyzed using a PEAK-2D motion analysis system during a 20-min continuous walk on a treadmill at self-selected walking speed. Gait features extracted from individual MFC histogram-plot and Poincare/spl acute/-plot images were used to train the SVM. Cross-validation test results indicate that the generalization performance of the SVM was on average 83.3\% (/spl plusmn/2.9) to recognize young and elderly gait patterns, compared to a neural network's accuracy of 75.0/spl plusmn/5.0. A "hill-climbing" feature selection algorithm demonstrated that a small subset (3-5) of gait features extracted from MFC plots could differentiate the gait patterns with 90\% accuracy. Performance of the gait classifier was evaluated using areas under the receiver operating characteristic plots. Improved performance of the classifier was evident when trained with reduced number of selected good features and with radial basis function kernel. These results suggest that SVMs can function as an efficient gait classifier for recognition of young and elderly gait patterns, and has the potential for wider applications in gait identification for falls-risk minimization in the elderly.},

  abstract = {Background: The risk of falling is significantly higher in people with chronic stroke and it is, therefore, important to design interventions to improve mobility and decrease falls risk. Minimum toe clearance (MTC) is the key gait cycle event for predicting tripping-falls because it occurs mid-swing during the walking cycle where forward velocity of the foot is maximum. High forward velocity coupled with low MTC increases the probability of unanticipated foot-ground contacts. Training procedures to increase toe-ground clearance (MTC) have potential, therefore, as a falls-prevention intervention. The aim of this project is to determine whether augmented sensory information via real-time visual biofeedback during gait training can increase MTC. Methods: Participants will be aged {$>$} 18 years, have sustained a single stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) at least six months previously, able to walk 50 m independently, and capable of informed consent. Using a secure web-based application (REDCap), 150 participants will be randomly assigned to either no-feedback (Control) or feedback (Experimental) groups; all will receive 10 sessions of treadmill training for up to 10 min at a self-selected speed over 5--6 weeks. The intervention group will receive real-time, visual biofeedback of MTC during training and will be asked to modify their gait pattern to match a required ``target'' criterion. Biofeedback is continuous for the first six sessions then progressively reduced (faded) across the remaining four sessions. Control participants will walk on the treadmill without biofeedback. Gait assessments are conducted at baseline, immediately following the final training session and then during follow-up, at one, three, and six months. The primary outcome measure is MTC. Monthly falls calendars will also be collected for 12 months from enrolment. Discussion: The project will contribute to understanding how stroke-related changes to sensory and motor processes influence gait biomechanics and associated tripping risk. The research findings will guide our work in gait rehabilitation following stroke and may reduce falls rates. Treadmill training procedures incorporating continuous real-time feedback may need to be modified to accommodate stroke patients who have greater difficulties with treadmill walking.},

For each leg, the algorithm detected the Initial Contact (IC), as the minimum of the flexion/extension angle, and the End Contact (EC) and the Mid-Swing (MS), as minimum and maximum of the angular velocity, respectively. The algorithm consisted of calibration, real-time detection, and step-by-step update. Data collected from 22 healthy subjects (21 to 85 years) walking at three self-selected speeds were used to validate the algorithm against the GaitRite system. Comparable levels of accuracy and significantly lower detection delays were achieved with respect to other published methods. The algorithm robustness was tested on ten healthy subjects performing sudden speed changes and on ten stroke subjects (43 to 89 years). For healthy subjects, F1-scores of 1 and mean detection delays lower than 14 ms were obtained. For stroke subjects, F1-scores of 0.998 and 0.944 were obtained for IC and EC, respectively, with mean detection delays always below 31 ms. The algorithm accurately detected gait events in real time from a heterogeneous dataset of gait patterns and paves the way for the design of closed-loop controllers for customized gait trainings and/or assistive devices.},

  abstract = {This document provides a review of the techniques and therapies used in gait rehabilitation after stroke. It also examines the possible benefits of including assistive robotic devices and brain-computer interfaces in this field, according to a top-down approach, in which rehabilitation is driven by neural plasticity. The methods reviewed comprise classical gait rehabilitation techniques (neurophysiological and motor learning approaches), functional electrical stimulation (FES), robotic devices, and brain-computer interfaces (BCI). From the analysis of these approaches, we can draw the following conclusions. Regarding classical rehabilitation techniques, there is insufficient evidence to state that a particular approach is more effective in promoting gait recovery than other. Combination of different rehabilitation strategies seems to be more effective than over-ground gait training alone. Robotic devices need further research to show their suitability for walking training and their effects on over-ground gait. The use of FES combined with different walking retraining strategies has shown to result in improvements in hemiplegic gait. Reports on non-invasive BCIs for stroke recovery are limited to the rehabilitation of upper limbs; however, some works suggest that there might be a common mechanism which influences upper and lower limb recovery simultaneously, independently of the limb chosen for the rehabilitation therapy. Functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) enables researchers to detect signals from specific regions of the cortex during performance of motor activities for the development of future BCIs. Future research would make possible to analyze the impact of rehabilitation on brain plasticity, in order to adapt treatment resources to meet the needs of each patient and to optimize the recovery process.},

Evidence supports peroneal nerve functional electrical stimulation (FES) as an effective alternative to ankle foot orthoses (AFO) for treatment of foot drop poststroke, but few long-term, randomized controlled comparisons exist. Objective. Compare changes in gait quality and function between FES and AFOs in individuals with foot drop poststroke over a 12-month period. Methods. Follow-up analysis of an unblinded randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov \#NCT01087957) conducted at 30 rehabilitation centers comparing FES to AFOs over 6 months. Subjects continued to wear their randomized device for another 6 months to final 12-month assessments. Subjects used study devices for all home and community ambulation. Multiply imputed intention-to-treat analyses were utilized; primary endpoints were tested for noninferiority and secondary endpoints for superiority. Primary endpoints: 10 Meter Walk Test (10MWT) and device-related serious adverse event rate. Secondary endpoints: 6-Minute Walk Test (6MWT), GaitRite Functional Ambulation Profile, and Modified Emory Functional Ambulation Profile (mEFAP). Results. A total of 495 subjects were randomized, and 384 completed the 12-month follow-up. FES proved noninferior to AFOs for all primary endpoints. Both FES and AFO groups showed statistically and clinically significant improvement for 10MWT compared with initial measurement. No statistically significant between-group differences were found for primary or secondary endpoints. The FES group demonstrated statistically significant improvements for 6MWT and mEFAP Stair-time subscore. Conclusions. At 12 months, both FES and AFOs continue to demonstrate equivalent gains in gait speed. Results suggest that long-term FES use may lead to additional improvements in walking endurance and functional ambulation; further research is needed to confirm these findings.},

  abstract = {The treatment to be discussed in this paper is based on neurophysiology, for cerebral palsy is not an orthop{\ae}dic but a neurological problem. Damage to the brain (the cause of cerebral palsy) leads to a disorder of muscular coordination and not to paralysis or paresis of muscles, as, for instance, in lower motor neurone lesions. We find disordered motor function in all patients, and often there are associated defects of vision, hearing, and speech. The motor system is affected centrally and therefore we do not confine ourselves to treating any particular muscle group but treat the body as a whole. The usual treatment consists of exercises used for orthop{\ae}dic cases as though the patient could control his muscle function in the normal way. A normal central nervous system allows the patient to direct his nervous impulses so that he can contract or relax specific muscle groups in order to move, say, an elbow, a hand, or a foot. In such a person we can strengthen weak muscles and teach the patient to correct faulty postures and movement patterns. The patient with cerebral palsy has all the muscle power he needs for movements and his peripheral nerve supply is intact, but he cannot direct the impulses to his muscles in the normal way so as to produce separate movements. Sometimes his posture becomes completely fixed and he cannot move at all. When he does move, however, the movement is widespread and there is no fixation. He cannot direct his movements either and often flexes a limb when he wants to extend and vice versa The patient cannot contract or relax individual muscle groups or move parts of the body independently of each other. His coordination of posture and movements is abnormal and this involves all the affected parts of the body. {\copyright} 1956, Australian Physiotherapy Association. All rights reserved.},

In the first part of the study, using a comprehensive, standardized questionnaire, 89 athletes (100 knees) were interviewed about the events surrounding their ACL injury. A noncontact mechanism was reported in 71 (72\%) knees and a contact injury in 28 (28\%) knees; one patient was unsure if there was any contact. Most of the injuries were sustained at footstrike with the knee close to full extension. Noncontact mechanisms were classified as sudden deceleration prior to a change of direction or landing motion, while contact injuries occurred as a result of valgus collapse of the knee. Hamstring flexibility parameters revealed a statistically higher level of laxity in the injured athletes compared with a matched group of 28 controls. In the second part of the study, videotapes of 27 separate ACL disruptions were reviewed and confirmed that most noncontact injuries occur with the knee close to extension during a sharp deceleration or landing maneuver. Because the knee is in a position to allow the extensor mechanism to strain the ACL and maximum, eccentric muscle force conditions usually apply, the quadriceps may play an important role in ACL disruption. Passive protection of the ACL by the hamstring muscles may be reduced in patients with above-average flexibility.},

Extensive validation of this system is still missing. The aim of the study was to determine if the Kinect (TM) sensor can be used as an easy, cheap and fast tool to conduct morphology estimation. A total of 48 subjects were analysed using MMC. Results were compared with measurements obtained from a high-resolution stereophotogrammetric system, a marker-based system (MBS). Differences between MMC and MBS were found; however, these differences were systematically correlated and enabled regression equations to be obtained to correct MMC results. After correction, final results were in agreement with MBS data (p=0.99). Results show that measurements were reproducible and precise after applying regression equations. Kinect (TM) sensors-based systems therefore seem to be suitable for use as fast and reliable tools to estimate morphology. Practitioner Summary: The Kinect (TM) sensor could eventually be used for fast morphology estimation as a body scanner. This paper presents an extensive validation of this device for anthropometric measurements in comparison to manual measurements and stereophotogrammetric devices.

The purpose of this study was to establish a quantifiable link between hemiparetic severity and paretic leg contribution to propulsion during walking, which we propose to quantify using a measure based on the anterior-posterior ground reaction forces (A-P GRFs).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: A total of 47 participants with chronic hemiparesis walked at self-selected speeds to collect spatiotemporal parameters and 3D GRFs. A 16-person subset also participated in a pedaling protocol to compare A-P GRF measures to established measures of paretic leg output.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: A-P GRF measures were correlated with both walking speed and hemiparetic severity. These measures were also strongly correlated with positive work and net work values obtained during the pedaling task. The percentage of total propulsion generated by the paretic leg (PP) was calculated and found to be 16\%, 36\%, and 49\% for those with high, moderate, and low hemiparetic severity, respectively.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: PP was found to provide a quantitative measure of the coordinated output of the paretic leg. Further research on this measure of forward propulsion may lead to the provision of an effective tool for distinguishing functional compensation from physiological restitution.},

Currently available clinical measures do not have the capacity to distinguish between neuromotor recovery and compensation for impaired underlying body structure/functions. This Special Interest article examines the state of outcomes measurement in physical therapy in regard to locomotor rehabilitation, and suggests approaches that may improve assessment of recovery and clinical decision-making capabilities. We examine historical approaches to measurement of locomotor rehabilitation outcomes, including rating scales, timed movement tasks, and laboratory-based outcome measures, and we discuss the emerging use of portable technology to assess walking in a free-living environment. The ability to accurately measure outcomes of rehabilitation, both in and away from the clinical/laboratory setting, allows assessment of skill acquisition, retention, and long-term carryover in a variety of environments. Accurate measurement allows behavioral changes to be observed, and assessments to be made, regarding an individual's ability to adapt during interventions and to incorporate new skills into real-world behaviors. The result of such an approach to assessment may be that interventions truly translate from clinical/laboratory to real-world environments. Future locomotor measurement tools must be based on a theoretical framework that can guide their use to accurately quantify treatment effects and provide a basis upon which to develop and refine therapeutic interventions.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To identify the clinical measures associated with improved walking speed after locomotor rehabilitation in individuals poststroke and how those who respond with clinically meaningful changes in walking speed differ from those with smaller speed increases. Design: A single group pre-post intervention study. Participants were stratified on the basis of a walking speed change of greater than (responders) or less than (nonresponders).16m/s. Paired sample t tests were run to assess changes in each group, and correlations were run between the change in each variable and change in walking speed. Setting: Outpatient interdisciplinary rehabilitation research center. Participants: Hemiparetic subjects (N=27) (17 left hemiparesis; 19 men; age: 58.74{\textpm}12.97y; 22.70{\textpm}16.38mo poststroke). Intervention: A 12-week locomotor intervention incorporating training on a treadmill with body weight support and manual trainers accompanied by training overground walking. Main Outcome Measures: Measures of motor control, balance, functional walking ability, and endurance were collected at pre- and postintervention assessments. Results: Eighteen responders and 9 nonresponders differed by age (responders=63.6y, nonresponders=49.0y, P=.001) and the lower extremity Fugl-Meyer Assessment score (responders=24.7, nonresponders=19.9, P=.003). Responders demonstrated an average improvement of.27m/s in walking speed as well as significant gains in all variables except daily step activity and paretic step ratio. Conversely, nonresponders demonstrated statistically significant improvements only in walking speed and endurance. However, the walking speed increase of.10m/s was not clinically meaningful. Change in walking speed was negatively correlated with changes in motor control in the nonresponder group, implying that walking speed gains may have been accomplished via compensatory mechanisms. Conclusions: This study is a step toward discerning the underlying factors contributing to improved walking performance.},

Technological developments have allowed accelerometers to be a feasible tool to provide digital gait variables. Many acceleration-derived variables are proposed to measure gait asymmetry. Despite a need for accurate calculation, no consensus exists for what is the most valid and reliable variable. Using an instrumented walkway (GaitRite) as the reference standard, this study compared the validity and reliability of multiple acceleration-derived asymmetry variables. Twenty-five post-stroke participants performed repeated walks over GaitRite whilst wearing a tri-axial accelerometer (Axivity AX3) on their lower back, on two occasions, one week apart. Harmonic ratio, autocorrelation, gait symmetry index, phase plots, acceleration, and jerk root mean square were calculated from the acceleration signals. Test--retest reliability was calculated, and concurrent validity was estimated by comparison with GaitRite. The strongest concurrent validity was obtained from step regularity from the vertical signal, which also recorded excellent test--retest reliability (Spearman's rank correlation coefficients (rho) = 0.87 and Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC21) = 0.98, respectively). Future research should test the responsiveness of this and other step asymmetry variables to quantify change during recovery and the effect of rehabilitative interventions for consideration as digital biomarkers to quantify gait asymmetry.},

  abstract = {During interplanetary missions, astronauts are exposed to mixed types of ionizing radiation. The low `flux' of the high atomic number and high energy (HZE) radiations relative to the higher `flux' of low linear energy transfer (LET) protons makes it highly probable that for any given cell in the body, proton events will precede any HZE event. Whereas progress has been made in our understanding of the biological effects of low-LET protons and high-LET HZE particles, the interplay between the biochemical processes modulated by these radiations is unclear. Here we show that exposure of normal human fibroblasts to a low mean absorbed dose of 20 cGy of 0.05 or 1-GeV protons (LET {$\sim$} 1.25 or 0.2 keV/{$\mu$}m, respectively) protects the irradiated cells (P {$<$} 0.0001) against chromosomal damage induced by a subsequent exposure to a mean absorbed dose of 50 cGy from 1 GeV/u iron ions (LET {$\sim$} 151 keV/{$\mu$}m). Surprisingly, unirradiated (i.e. bystander) cells with which the proton-irradiated cells were co-cultured were also significantly protected from the DNA-damaging effects of the challenge dose. The mitigating effect persisted for at least 24 h. These results highlight the interactions of biological effects due to direct cellular traversal by radiation with those due to bystander effects in cell populations exposed to mixed radiation fields. They show that protective adaptive responses can spread from cells targeted by low-LET space radiation to bystander cells in their vicinity. The findings are relevant to understanding the health hazards of space travel.},

Earlier studies showed that single-wavelength far-UVC light (207 nm) generated by excimer lamps kills bacteria without apparent harm to human skin tissue in vitro. The biophysical explanation is that, due to its extremely short range in biological material, 207 nm UV light cannot penetrate the human stratum corneum (the outer dead-cell skin layer, thickness 5--20 {$\mu$}m) nor even the cytoplasm of individual human cells. By contrast, 207 nm UV light can penetrate bacteria and viruses because these cells are physically much smaller.},

Thirty-five healthy subjects consented to participate in the study that included collection of bilateral GRF and muscle activity of the back, trunk, and legs during the stance phase of walking and sit--stand tasks. No significant differences in SI values between the ND and D sides of the body were found, indicating that asymptomatic subjects walk, stand up, and sit down in a rather symmetric manner. Gait stance time, peak vertical GRF at heel strike, and peak vertical GRF during the entire sit--stand cycle were found to be ``perfectly symmetrical'' with SI values equal to 1. Future studies will involve similar analyses to determine the level of asymmetry among symptomatic subjects.},

DESIGN: Qualitative research methods (in-depth individual interviews and group interviews) were used to assess the characteristics of successful weight maintainers, as compared with weight regainers and healthy-weight women. SUBJECTS: In all, 76 females were recruited from the community, comprising 28 formerly obese women who had lost weight and maintained their new lower weight for at least 1 y; 28 obese women who had lost weight but regained the weight that they had lost; and 20 women with a stable weight in the healthy range. RESULTS: Certain psychological factors were identified which characterised the regainers but not the maintainers. These factors were: failure to achieve weight goals and dissatisfaction with the weight achieved; the tendency to evaluate self-worth in terms of weight and shape; a lack of vigilance with regard to weight control; a dichotomous (black-and-white) thinking style; and the tendency to use eating to regulate mood. Conclusion: The results suggest that psychological factors may provide some explanation as to why many people with obesity regain weight following successful weight loss. The factors identified in this study need to be examined further using prospective designs.},

This paper aims to summarize studies that applied adaptive also called artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms to gait analysis based on inertial sensor data, verifying if they can support the clinical evaluation. Articles were identified through searches of the main databases, which were encompassed from 1968 to October 2016. We have identified 22 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The included papers were analyzed due to their data acquisition and processing methods with specific questionnaires. Concerning the data acquisition, the mean score is 6.1~{\textpm}~1.62, what implies that 13 of 22 papers failed to report relevant outcomes. The quality assessment of AI algorithms presents an above-average rating (8.2~{\textpm}~1.84). Therefore, AI algorithms seem to be able to support gait analysis based on inertial sensor data. Further research, however, is necessary to enhance and standardize the application in patients, since most of the studies used distinct methods to evaluate healthy subjects.},

  abstract = {Hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) approaches have been used to provide a general scheme for chemical reactions in proteins. However, such approaches still present a major challenge to computational chemists, not only because of the need for very large computer time in order to evaluate the QM energy but also because of the need for proper computational sampling. This review focuses on the sampling issue in QM/MM evaluations of electrostatic energies in proteins. We chose this example since electrostatic energies play a major role in controlling the function of proteins and are key to the structure-function correlation of biological molecules. Thus, the correct treatment of electrostatics is essential for the accurate simulation of biological systems. Although we will be presenting different types of QM/MM calculations of electrostatic energies (and related properties) here, our focus will be on pKa calculations. This reflects the fact that pKa's of ionizable groups in proteins provide one of the most direct benchmarks for the accuracy of electrostatic models of macromolecules. While pKa calculations by semimacroscopic models have given reasonable results in many cases, existing attempts to perform pKa calculations using QM/MM-FEP have led to discrepancies between calculated and experimental values. In this work, we accelerate our QM/MM calculations using an updated mean charge distribution and a classical reference potential. We examine both a surface residue (Asp3) of the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor and a residue buried in a hydrophobic pocket (Lys102) of the T4-lysozyme mutant. We demonstrate that, by using this approach, we are able to reproduce the relevant side chain pKa's with an accuracy of 3 kcal/mol. This is well within the 7 kcal/mol energy difference observed in studies of enzymatic catalysis, and is thus sufficient accuracy to determine the main contributions to the catalytic energies of enzymes. We also provide an overall perspective of the potential of QM/MM calculations in general evaluations of electrostatic free energies, pointing out that our approach should provide a very powerful and accurate tool to predict the electrostatics of not only solution but also enzymatic reactions, as well as the solvation free energies of even larger systems, such as nucleic acid bases incorporated into DNA.},

  abstract = {Experimental methods in Biomechanics have been adopted for analyzing sports performance, although a systematic use has been not widely diffused. An important factor for this limitation lies in the difficulty of extending results obtained inside a laboratory, to a real sport performance. Recent technological developments in Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems raise the possibility to overcome such a limitation. This work represents a feasibility study to evaluate kinematics and muscle activation during a typical elite soccer team coaching session. One professional soccer player under the S.S. Lazio was equipped with wireless Inertial Measurement Units and wireless electromyography modules. Data were acquired in real-time during running, sprinting, and jumping trials, performed on the regular team coaching field, with the aim of exploring biomechanical variables. Results showed a symmetric kinematic behavior of the lower limbs during the three activities. Conversely, electromyography highlighted an asymmetric activation of the correspondent muscles of the two sides. This study opens the way for a novel method for sport training, leveraging findings made available via micro-technology to permit a more focused training. These findings call for a more extended experimental session, enrolling more subjects, both healthy and injured, to further explore the possibility of novel approaches to athlete-specific rehabilitation.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To analyze the feasibility and efficacy of a novel system (Gamepad [GAMing Experience in PArkinson's Disease]) for biofeedback rehabilitation of balance and gait in Parkinson disease (PD). Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: Clinical rehabilitation gym. Participants: Subjects with PD (NZ42) were randomized into experimental and physiotherapy without biofeedback groups. Interventions: Both groups underwent 20 sessions of training for balance and gait. The experimental group performed tailored functional tasks using Gamepad. The system, based on wearable inertial sensors, provided users with real-time visual and acoustic feedback about their movement during the exercises. The physiotherapy group underwent individually structured physiotherapy without feedback. Main Outcome Measures: Assessments were performed by a blinded examiner preintervention, postintervention, and at 1-month follow-up. Primary outcomes were the Berg Balance Scale (BBS) and 10-m walk test (10MWT). Secondary outcomes included instrumental stabilometric indexes and the Tele-healthcare Satisfaction Questionnaire. Results: Gamepad was well accepted by participants. Statistically significant between-group differences in BBS scores suggested better balance performances of the experimental group compared with the physiotherapy without biofeedback group both posttraining (experimental group{\`A}physiotherapy without biofeedback group: mean, 2.3{\AE}3.4 points; PZ.047) and at follow-up (experimental group{\`A}physiotherapy without biofeedback group: mean, 2.7{\AE}3.3 points; PZ.018). Posttraining stabilometric indexes showed that mediolateral body sway during upright stance was significantly reduced in the experimental group compared with the physiotherapy without biofeedback group (experimental group{\`A}physiotherapy without biofeedback group: {\`A}1.6{\AE}1.5mm; PZ.003). No significant between-group differences were found in the other outcomes. Conclusions: Gamepad-based training was feasible and superior to physiotherapy without feedback in improving BBS performance and retaining it for 1 month. After training, 10MWT data were comparable between groups. Further development of the system is warranted to allow the autonomous use of Gamepad outside clinical settings, to enhance gait improvements, and to increase transfer of training effects to real-life contexts.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microtechnology has allowed sport scientists to understand the locomotor demands of various sports. While wearable global positioning technology has been used to quantify the locomotor demands of sporting activities, microsensors (i.e. accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers) embedded within the units also have the capability to detect sport-specific movements.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nOBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the extent to which microsensors (also referred to as inertial measurement units and microelectromechanical sensors) have been utilised in quantifying sport-specific movements.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: A systematic review of the use of microsensors and associated terms to evaluate sport-specific movements was conducted; permutations of the terms used included alternate names of the various technologies used, their applications and different applied environments. Studies for this review were published between 2008 and 2014 and were identified through a systematic search of six electronic databases: Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, PsycINFO, PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science. Articles were required to have used athlete-mounted sensors to detect sport-specific movements (e.g. rugby union tackle) rather than sensors mounted to equipment and monitoring generic movement patterns.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: A total of 2395 studies were initially retrieved from the six databases and 737 results were removed as they were duplicates, review articles or conference abstracts. After screening titles and abstracts of the remaining papers, the full text of 47 papers was reviewed, resulting in the inclusion of 28 articles that met the set criteria around the application of microsensors for detecting sport-specific movements. Eight articles addressed the use of microsensors within individual sports, team sports provided seven results, water sports provided eight articles, and five articles addressed the use of microsensors in snow sports. All articles provided evidence of the ability of microsensors to detect sport-specific movements. Results demonstrated varying purposes for the use of microsensors, encompassing the detection of movement and movement frequency, the identification of movement errors and the assessment of forces during collisions.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSION: This systematic review has highlighted the use of microsensors to detect sport-specific movements across a wide range of individual and team sports. The ability of microsensors to capture sport-specific movements emphasises the capability of this technology to provide further detail on athlete demands and performance. However, there was mixed evidence on the ability of microsensors to quantify some movements (e.g. tackling within rugby union, rugby league and Australian rules football). Given these contrasting results, further research is required to validate the ability of wearable microsensors containing accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers to detect tackles in collision sports, as well as other contact events such as the ruck, maul and scrum in rugby union.},

  abstract = {Treadmill walking was used to assess the consistent gait differences between six individuals with post-stroke hemiparesis and six non-disabled, healthy controls at matched speeds. The hemiparetic subjects walked on the treadmill at their comfortable speeds, while each control walked at the same speed as the hemiparetic subject with whom he or she was matched. Kinematic and insole pressure data were collected from multiple, steady-state gait cycles. A large set of gait differences found between hemiparetic and non-disabled subjects was consistent with impaired swing initiation in the paretic limb (i.e., inadequate propulsion of the leg during pre-swing, increased percentage swing time, and reduced knee flexion at toe-off and mid-swing in the paretic limb) and related compensatory strategies (i.e., pelvic hiking and swing-phase propulsion and circumduction of the paretic limb). Exaggerated positive work associated with raising the trunk during pre-swing and swing of the paretic limb, consistent with pelvic hiking, contributed to increased mechanical energetic cost during walking. A second set of gait differences found was consistent with impaired single limb support on the paretic limb (i.e., shortened support time on the paretic limb) and related compensatory strategies (i.e., exaggerated propulsion of the non-paretic limb during pre-swing to shorten its swing time). Other significant gait differences included asymmetry in step length and increased step width. We conclude that consistent gait differences exist between hemiparetic and non-disabled subjects walking at matched speeds. The differences provide insights, concerning hemiparetic impairment and related compensatory strategies, that are in addition to the observation of slow walking speed.},

  abstract = {Following stroke many individuals are left with neurological and functional deficits, including hemiparesis, which impair their ability to walk. Our previous work reported that propulsion of the paretic leg during pre-swing is impaired and may limit gait speed and knee flexion during swing. To elucidate the mechanism of this impairment, we assessed the mechanical work produced by the hip, knee, and ankle moments during pre-swing of the paretic limb in a group of stroke subjects and compared it with the work produced by non-disabled controls walking at similar speeds. Kinematic and kinetic gait data were collected from 23 hemiparetic and 10 control subjects. The hemiparetic subjects walked at their self-selected speeds. The controls walked at their self-selected and two or three slower speeds. Even when compared to controls walking at slow speeds, ankle plantarflexor work during pre-swing was greatly reduced (-0.136{\textpm}0.062 J/kg) in the hemiparetic subjects. Differences in hip (+0.006{\textpm}0.020 J/kg) and knee (+0.040{\textpm}0.026 J/kg) moment work partially offset the reduction in ankle work, but net joint moment work was still significantly reduced (-0.088{\textpm}0.056 J/kg). The reduction in work accounts for the low energy of the paretic limb at the stance-to-swing transition previously reported. Future investigation is needed to determine if targeted training of the plantarflexors in the paretic limb improves swing-phase function and locomotor performance in hemiparetic individuals.},

  abstract = {Production of voluntary movements relies critically on the functional integration of several motor cortical areas, such as the primary motor cortex, and the spinal circuitries. Surprisingly, after almost 40 years of research, how the motor cortices specify descending neural signals destined for the downstream interneurons and motoneurons has remained elusive. In light of the many recent experimental demonstrations that the motor system may coordinate muscle activations through a linear combination of muscle synergies, we hypothesize that the motor cortices may function to select and activate fixed muscle synergies specified by the spinal or brainstem networks. To test this hypothesis, we recorded electromyograms (EMGs) from 12-16 upper arm and shoulder muscles from both the unaffected and the stroke-affected arms of stroke patients having moderate-to-severe unilateral ischemic lesions in the frontal motor cortical areas. Analyses of EMGs using a nonnegative matrix factorization algorithm revealed that in seven of eight patients the muscular compositions of the synergies for both the unaffected and the affected arms were strikingly similar to each other despite differences in motor performance between the arms, and differences in cerebral lesion sizes and locations between patients. This robustness of muscle synergies that we observed supports the notion that descending cortical signals represent neuronal drives that select, activate, and flexibly combine muscle synergies specified by networks in the spinal cord and/or brainstem. Our conclusion also suggests an approach to stroke rehabilitation by focusing on those synergies with altered activations after stroke.},

Cortical damage, whether by trauma or stroke, interferes with the flow of descending signals to the mod- ular interneuronal structures of the spinal cord. These spinal mod- ules subserve normal motor behaviors by activating groups of muscles as individual units (muscle synergies). Damage to the mo- tor cortical areas disrupts the orchestration of the modules, result- ing in abnormal movements. To gain insights into this complex process, we recorded myoelectric signals from multiple upper-limb muscles in subjects with cortical lesions. We used a factorization algorithm to identify the muscle synergies. Our factorization anal- ysis revealed, in a quantitative way, three distinct patterns of muscle coordination---including preservation, merging, and frac- tionation of muscle synergies---that reflect the multiple neural responses that occur after cortical damage. These patterns varied as a function of both the severity of functional impairment and the temporal distance from stroke onset. We think these muscle-syn- ergy patterns can be used as physiological markers of the status of any patient with stroke or trauma, thereby guiding the develop- ment of different rehabilitation approaches, as well as future physiological experiments for a further understanding of postin- jury mechanisms of motor control and recovery.},

Use of an IMU for clinical study, rehabilitation, and in the design of orthoses and prostheses has increased tremendously. However, its use in defining running gait is limited. This study presents a practical method to estimate running spatial and temporal parameters using an inertial sensor by placing it on a shoe. A combination of a zero-crossing method and thresholding is used to identify foot-strike and foot-off based on foot acceleration during running. Stride time, ground contact time and flight time can then be identified. An off-phase segmentation algorithm is applied to estimate stride length and running speed. These two parameters are commonly used to evaluate running efficiency and to differentiate elite runners. This study found that an IMU can estimate footstrike and foot-off with average absolute time differences of 2.60-6.04 and 2.61-16.28 ms, respectively. Stride time was estimated with error between -4.04 and 0.33 ms. Stride length and running speed were estimated with maximum average errors of 45.97 mm and 0.41 km/h.},

The subjects were aged from 20 to 60 years and both genders were equally represented. A nested-factorial analysis of variance was employed. The independent variables include walking speed (80\%, 100\%, 120\%, and 140\% PPWS), age (young, middle, and older groups) and gender. The response measures include lower limb joint motion, vertical ground reaction force (VGRF), muscle electromyography (EMG), heart rate, and perceived exertion of whole body and local areas. The results show that different age and gender groups had similar gait performance on most of the joint motions, HR, as well as the perceived exertions while walking at a range of PPWS. In addition, these performance generally increased with the increasing walking speed and the trend becomes more obvious when the speed was higher than 120\% PWS. Age and gender differences have been found in VGRFs and muscle EMG. Females exhibited significantly higher VGRF in the heel-strike and toe-off stages, as well as higher tibialis anterior muscle activity. Older subjects had significantly higher rectus femoris muscle activity than younger adults. Besides, the interaction between gender and walking speed was significant on VGRF in the toe-off stage.

  abstract = {Little is known about the integration of neural mechanisms for balance and locomotion. Muscle synergies have been studied independently in standing balance and walking, but not compared. Here, we hypothesized that reactive balance and walking are mediated by a common set of lower-limb muscle synergies. In humans, we examined muscle activity during multidirectional support-surface perturbations during standing and walking, as well as unperturbed walking at two speeds. We show that most muscle synergies used in perturbations responses during standing were also used in perturbation responses during walking, suggesting common neural mechanisms for reactive balance across different contexts. We also show that most muscle synergies using in reactive balance were also used during unperturbed walking, suggesting that neural circuits mediating locomotion and reactive balance recruit a common set of muscle synergies to achieve task-level goals. Differences in muscle synergies across conditions reflected differences in the biomechanical demands of the tasks. For example, muscle synergies specific to walking perturbations may reflect biomechanical challenges associated with single limb stance, and muscle synergies used during sagittal balance recovery in standing but not walking were consistent with maintaining the different desired center of mass motions in standing vs. walking. Thus, muscle synergies specifying spatial organization of muscle activation patterns may define a repertoire of biomechanical subtasks available to different neural circuits governing walking and reactive balance and may be recruited based on task-level goals. Muscle synergy analysis may aid in dissociating deficits in spatial vs. temporal organization of muscle activity in motor deficits. Muscle synergy analysis may also provide a more generalizable assessment of motor function by identifying whether common modular mechanisms are impaired across the performance of multiple motor tasks.},

  abstract = {Evidence suggests that the nervous system controls motor tasks using a low-dimensional modular organization of muscle activation. However, it is not clear if such an organization applies to coordination of human walking, nor how nervous system injury may alter the organization of motor modules and their biomechanical outputs. We first tested the hypothesis that muscle activation patterns during walking are produced through the variable activation of a small set of motor modules. In 20 healthy control subjects, EMG signals from eight leg muscles were measured across a range of walking speeds. Four motor modules identified through nonnegative matrix factorization were sufficient to account for variability of muscle activation from step to step and across speeds. Next, consistent with the clinical notion of abnormal limb flexion-extension synergies post-stroke, we tested the hypothesis that subjects with post-stroke hemiparesis would have altered motor modules, leading to impaired walking performance. In post-stroke subjects ( n = 55), a less complex coordination pattern was shown. Fewer modules were needed to account for muscle activation during walking at preferred speed compared with controls. Fewer modules resulted from merging of the modules observed in healthy controls, suggesting reduced independence of neural control signals. The number of modules was correlated to preferred walking speed, speed modulation, step length asymmetry, and propulsive asymmetry. Our results suggest a common modular organization of muscle coordination underlying walking in both healthy and post-stroke subjects. Identification of motor modules may lead to new insight into impaired locomotor coordination and the underlying neural systems.},

The Microsoft Kinect system provides real-time anatomical landmark position data in three dimensions (3D), and given that it is inexpensive, portable and simple to setup it may bridge this gap. This study assessed the concurrent validity of the Microsoft Kinect against a benchmark reference, a multiple-camera 3D motion analysis system, in 20 healthy subjects during three postural control tests: (i) forward reach, (ii) lateral reach, and (iii) single-leg eyes-closed standing balance. For the reach tests, the outcome measures consisted of distance reached and trunk flexion angle in the sagittal (forward reach) and coronal (lateral reach) planes. For the standing balance test the range and deviation of movement in the anatomical landmark positions for the sternum, pelvis, knee and ankle and the lateral and anterior trunk flexion angle were assessed. The Microsoft Kinect and 3D motion analysis systems had comparable inter-trial reliability (ICC difference=0.06+/-0.05; range, 0.00-0.16) and excellent concurrent validity, with Pearson's r-values {$>$}0.90 for the majority of measurements (r=0.96+/-0.04; range, 0.84-0.99). However, ordinary least products analyses demonstrated proportional biases for some outcome measures associated with the pelvis and sternum. These findings suggest that the Microsoft Kinect can validly assess kinematic strategies of postural control. Given the potential benefits it could therefore become a useful tool for assessing postural control in the clinical setting.},

No general consensus exists, however, as to what fundamental compensatory actions are made at the knee and hip joints by the OG to compensate for this loss of power. The failure to control gait speed may account for this lack of agreement. This study investigated the effect of aging on lower limb joint power and work during gait. The gait patterns of eight old (OG: 66.8 {\AE} 5.4 yr) and 12 young adults (YG: 26.6 {\AE} 2.9 yr) were recorded for a range of matched speeds (1.0 m s{\`A}1, 1.3 m s{\`A}1, 1.6 m s{\`A}1). Speed did not differ between the groups. Combining speeds, the OG generated 17\% less A2 power and 21\% less A2 work (p {$<$} 0.05). Compared to the YG, the OG generated 46\% more H1 work, 30\% more H2 peak power, 16\% more H3 peak power, 30\% more K3 peak power and 19\% more K4 peak power (p {$<$} 0.05). These actions by the OG were associated with less ankle plantar-flexion, more hip flexion and anterior pelvic tilt (p {$<$} 0.05). The OG adopted a different gait pattern at the faster speeds by generating more H3 work than A2 work. This shows the OG rely on hip flexors to propel the leg into swing when ankle plantar-flexor function is reduced. This may partly explain how gait changes emerge with aging.},

Targets for muscle activity or joint motion were displayed on the feedback screen along with timing cues that prompted muscle activity or joint flesionlextension at specific times during the gait cycle. The purpose was to compare the effectiveness of joint angle and eiectromyographic (EMG) feedback to a focused program of physical therapy for gait. Eight hemiplegic stroke patients were treated with ankle joint angle feedback, EMG biofeedback from the soleus muscle, and conventional physical therapy for gait in a three-period crossover design. PT was given either first or last in the sequence of treatments. Gait analysis prior to and following each type of treatment revealed that the feedback treatments resulted in significant increases in stride length and walking velocity and in positive changes in push-off impulse, gait symmetry, and standing weight-bearing symmetry, as evaluated in a general linear model and paired t-tests. Overall, physical therapy produced no significant changes. However, when physical therapy was the first treatment of the sequence, significant increases in stride length and velocity were observed. When physical therapy was last, there were significant negative changes in gait symmetry and standing weight-bearing symmetry, and negative trends in stride length, walking velocity, and push-off impulse. It is concluded that computer-assisted feedback is an effective tool for retraining gait in stroke patients.},

To evaluate the system, three studies were performed. The method was first tested on 10 healthy young volunteer subjects in a gait laboratory where an ultrasonic motion system was used as a reference system. In the second study, the system was tested on three hospitalized elderly people to classify walking upstairs from walking downstairs and flat walking. In the third study, monitoring was performed on seven patients with peripheral vascular disease for 60 min during their daily physical activity. The first study revealed a close relationship between the ambulatory and the reference systems. Compared to the reference system, the ambulatory system had an overall sensitivity and specificity of 98\% and 97\%, respectively. In the second study, the ambulatory system also showed a very high sensitivity ({$>$}94\%) in identifying a 50 stairs ascent from walking on the flat and walking downstairs. Finally, compared with visual surveillance, we observed a relatively high accuracy in identifying 196 walking upstairs cycles through daily physical activity in the third study. Our results demonstrated a reliable technique of measuring walking upstairs during physical activity.},

Therefore three different datasets are developed: raw voltage values, calibrated sensor signals and a calibrated estimation of total ground reaction force and position of the plantar center of pressure. The method is tested on a pool of 5 healthy subjects, through a leave-one-out cross validation. The results show high classification performances achieved using estimated biomechanical variables, being on average the 96\%. Calibrated signals and raw voltage values show higher delays and dispersions in phase transition detection, suggesting a lower reliability for online applications.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine whether the walking activity of persons with stroke could be increased through participation in a step activity monitoring program and to assess whether this occurred through a change in the structure of walking activity. Method: Sixteen individuals living with chronic stroke (46 months post-stroke) wore a StepWatch Activity Monitor (SAM) and completed a four-week goal centered activity monitoring program. Descriptors of step activity were averaged across baseline and the last week of monitoring, and were used to analyze the changes. Descriptors of step activity included: steps per day, bouts per day, steps per bout, total time walking per day, and the number of short (540 steps), medium (41--500 steps), and long (4500 steps) walking bouts. Results: As a group, the number of steps per day significantly increased over the four weeks of activity monitoring (p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.005). Subjects also demonstrated a significant improvement in the total time walking (p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.023), and the number of medium (p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.033) and long (p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.050) walking bouts. At the baseline and the final assessment, more than half of the bouts were short bouts of walking (67.6 {\textpm} 8\% and 68.2 {\textpm} 8\% respectively). Conclusions: A goal centered step activity monitoring program can improve daily walking activity after stroke through increases in the amount of total time walking, and medium and long walking bouts.},

The many degrees of freedom of the musculoskeletal apparatus provide great flexibility but make the control problem extremely complex. Muscle synergies--coherent activations, in space or time, of a group of muscles--have been proposed as building blocks that could simplify the construction of motor behaviors. To evaluate this hypothesis, we developed a new method to extract invariant spatiotemporal components from the simultaneous recordings of the activity of many muscles. We used this technique to analyze the muscle patterns of intact and unrestrained frogs during kicking, a natural defensive behavior. Here we show that combinations of three time-varying muscle synergies underlie the variety of muscle patterns required to kick in different directions, that the recruitment of these synergies is related to movement kinematics, and that there are similarities among the synergies extracted from different behaviors.},

This work tested the temporal relationships of these components. Our hypotheses were: 1) there would be associations among physical impairment, activity limitations and participation restrictions within time; 2) prior status of a component would be associated with future status; 3) prior status of one component would influence status of a second component (e.g. prior activity limitations would be associated with current participation restrictions); and, 4) the magnitude of the within time relationships of the components would vary over time. Participants from Canada with primary hip or knee joint replacement (n = 931), an intervention with predictable improvement in pain and disability, completed standardized outcome measures pre-surgery and five times in the first year post-surgery. These included physical impairment (pain), activity limitations and participation restrictions. ICF component relationships were evaluated cross-sectionally and longitudinally using path analysis adjusting for age, sex, BMI, hip vs. knee, low back pain and mood. All component scores improved significantly over time. The path coefficients supported the hypotheses in that both within and across time, physical impairment was associated with activity limitation and activity limitation was associated with participation restriction; prior status and change in a component were associated with current status in another component; and, the magnitude of the path coefficients varied over time with stronger associations among components to three months post surgery than later in recovery with the exception of the association between impairment and participation restrictions which was of similar magnitude at all times. This work enhances understanding of the complexities of the ICF component relationships in evaluating disability over time. Further longitudinal studies including evaluation of contextual factors are required. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

Investigate whether an exercise intervention can enhance mobility, prevent falls, and increase physical activity among community-dwelling people after stroke. Method. A randomized trial with blinding of physical outcome assessment was conducted through local stroke clubs. Both groups, on average 5.9 years poststroke, received exercise classes, advice, and a home program for 12 months.The experimental group (EG) program (n = 76) aimed to improve walking, prevent falls and increase physical activity. The control group (CG) program (n = 75) aimed to improve upper-limb and cognitive functions. The primary outcomes were walking capacity, walking speed measured before and after the intervention, and fall rates monitored monthly. Results. At 12 months, the EG walked 34 m further in 6 minutes (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1950; P {$<$} .001) and 0.07 m/s faster over 10 m (95\% CI = 0.01-0.14; P = .03) than the CG. The EG had 129 falls, and the CG had 133.There were no differences in proportion of fallers (relative risk = 1.22; 95\% CI = 0.91-1.62; P = .19) or the rate of falls between groups (incidence rate ratio = 0.96; 95\% CI = 0.59-1.51; P = .88).

The purpose of this paper was to outline the evolution of postoperative rehabilitation following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. Because of the controversy surrounding accelerated ACL rehabilitation and the concept of gaining terminal knee extension immediately following reconstruction, the authors felt justified in carrying out a retrospective comparison of traditional rehabilitation versus an accelerated approach. The objective variables under consideration included range of motion, isokinetic strength, and ligamentous stability. Results showed that active and passive range of motion, including hyperextension, returned more quickly and more fully in the accelerated group. Ligamentous stability was found to be equal to or better in the accelerated group despite a more aggressive rehabilitation approach. The results of this study indicated that an accelerated rehabilitation program following ACL reconstruction resulted in improved range of motion and strength gains without compromising stability.

  abstract = {Finding muscle activity generating a given motion is a redundant problem, since there are many more muscles than degrees of freedom. The control strategies determining muscle recruitment from a redundant set are still poorly understood. One theory of motor control suggests that motion is produced through activating a small number of muscle synergies, i.e., muscle groups that are activated in a fixed ratio by a single input signal. Because of the reduced number of input signals, synergy-based control is low dimensional. But a major criticism on the theory of synergy-based control of muscles is that muscle synergies might reflect task constraints rather than a neural control strategy. Another theory of motor control suggests that muscles are recruited by optimizing performance. Optimization of performance has been widely used to calculate muscle recruitment underlying a given motion while assuming independent recruitment of muscles. If synergies indeed determine muscle recruitment underlying a given motion, optimization approaches that do not model synergy-based control could result in muscle activations that do not show the synergistic muscle action observed through electromyography (EMG). If, however, synergistic muscle action results from performance optimization and task constraints (joint kinematics and external forces), such optimization approaches are expected to result in low-dimensional synergistic muscle activations that are similar to EMG-based synergies. We calculated muscle recruitment underlying experimentally measured gait patterns by optimizing performance assuming independent recruitment of muscles. We found that the muscle activations calculated without any reference to synergies can be accurately explained by on average four synergies. These synergies are similar to EMG-based synergies. We therefore conclude that task constraints and performance optimization explain synergistic muscle recruitment from a redundant set of muscles.},

The method proposes a minimal sensor configuration with one sensor module mounted on each segment. The model is based on estimating the acceleration of the joint center of rotation by placing a pair of virtual sensors on the adjacent segments at the center of rotation. In the proposed technique, joint angles are found without the need for integration, so absolute angles can be obtained which are free from any source of drift. The model considers anatomical aspects and is personalized for each subject prior to each measurement. The method was validated by measuring knee flexion-extension angles of eight subjects, walking at three different speeds, and comparing the results with a reference motion measurement system. The results are very close to those of the reference system presenting very small errors (rms=1.3, mean=0.2, SD=1.1 deg) and excellent correlation coefficients (0.997). The algorithm is able to provide joint angles in real-time, and ready for use in gait analysis. Technically, the system is portable, easily mountable, and can be used for long term monitoring without hindrance to natural activities.},

  abstract = {Background: The ability to walk independently is a primary goal for rehabilitation after stroke. Gait analysis provides a great amount of valuable information, while functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offers a powerful approach to define networks involved in motor control. The present study reports a new methodology based on both fMRI and gait analysis outcomes in order to investigate the ability of fMRI to reflect the phases of motor learning before/after electromyographic biofeedback treatment: the preliminary fMRI results of a post stroke subject's brain activation, during passive and active ankle dorsal/plantarflexion, before and after biofeedback (BFB) rehabilitation are reported and their correlation with gait analysis data investigated. Methods: A control subject and a post-stroke patient with chronic hemiparesis were studied. Functional magnetic resonance images were acquired during a block-design protocol on both subjects while performing passive and active ankle dorsal/plantarflexion. fMRI and gait analysis were assessed on the patient before and after electromyographic biofeedback rehabilitation treatment during gait activities. Lower limb three-dimensional kinematics, kinetics and surface electromyography were evaluated. Correlation between fMRI and gait analysis categorical variables was assessed: agreement/disagreement was assigned to each variable if the value was in/outside the normative range (gait analysis), or for presence of normal/diffuse/no activation of motor area (fMRI). Results: Altered fMRI activity was found on the post-stroke patient before biofeedback rehabilitation with respect to the control one. Meanwhile the patient showed a diffuse, but more limited brain activation after treatment (less voxels). The post-stroke gait data showed a trend towards the normal range: speed, stride length, ankle power, and ankle positive work increased. Preliminary correlation analysis revealed that consistent changes were observed both for the fMRI data, and the gait analysis data after treatment (R {$>$} 0.89): this could be related to the possible effects BFB might have on the central as well as on the peripheral nervous system. Conclusions: Our findings showed that this methodology allows evaluation of the relationship between alterations in gait and brain activation of a post-stroke patient. Such methodology, if applied on a larger sample subjects, could provide information about the specific motor area involved in a rehabilitation treatment.},

Here, we suppose a causal link between the level of degeneracy in the system and the strength of long-range correlations in its behavior. In a numerical experiment, we manipulated degeneracy through the number of networks available in a model composed of a chain of correlated networks over which a series of random jumps are performed. Results showed that correlations in the outcome series increased with the number of available networks, and that a minimal threshold of degeneracy was required to generate long-range correlations. We conclude that degeneracy could underlie the presence of long-range correlations in the outcome series produced by complex systems. In turn, we suggest that quantifying long-range correlations could allow to assess the level of degeneracy of the system. Degeneracy affords a maybe more intuitive way than former hypotheses for understanding the effects of complexity on essential properties such as robustness and adaptability.},

The energy cost was twice normal in slow walkers and 1.3 times greater in fast walkers. The increase in C was proportional to the increase in Wtot and {$\eta$} was normal at around 20\%, despite an increase in muscle tone and muscle co-contractions.

  abstract = {Wearable robotic devices have been shown to substantially reduce the energy expenditure of human walking. However, response variance between subjects for fixed control strategies can be high, leading to the hypothesis that individualized controllers could further improve walking economy. Recent studies on human-in-the-loop (HIL) control optimization have elucidated several practical challenges---in particular, long protocols and low signal-to-noise ratios. Here we show a method using Bayesian optimization---an algorithm well-suited to noisy signals with very limited data---to identify optimal peak and offset timing of hip extension assistance that minimizes the energy expenditure of walking with a textile-based wearable device. Optimal peak and offset timing were found over an average of 21.4 {\textpm} 1.0 min and reduced metabolic cost by 17.4 {\textpm} 3.2\% compared to walking without the device (mean {\textpm} s.e.m), which represented an improvement of more than 60\% on metabolic reduction compared to state-of-the-art devices only assisting hip extension. In addition, our results provide evidence for subject-specific metabolic distributions with respect to peak and offset timing, metabolic landscapes, lending support to the hypothesis that individualized control strategies can offer substantial benefits over fixed control strategies. These results also suggest that this method could have practical impact on improving the performance of wearable robotic devices.}

  abstract = {The development of robust control for restoration of gait, as well as the assessment of the achieved gait, was the main motivation for starting this project. Recent neurophysiology findings suggest that mimicking temporal characteristics of the biological control could lead to effective control of the assistive system used in rehabilitation of the walking. This ultimately leads to the idea of using the finitestate model of gait. Today, low cost, easy to mount, micromachined accelerometers are available; hence, we decided to study the applicability of these sensors for creating of gait model. The detailed analysis of the data recorded with many sensors resulted in the conclusion that four accelerometers mounted on the foot, shank and thigh provide a detailed temporal description of the gait. The automatic recognition of phases was done by introducing the coding of three discrete values: -1, 0 and 1. The automatic coding was based on the thresholds (low values around zero). The verification of the finite state model was done by comparing the timings of gait events obtained from force sensing resistors mounted in the shoes, and the timings obtained from accelerations. The measure of the success was the correlation between the gait phases determined: the correlation was greater than 900/0, which is within the range of variability of the gait events in normal walking.},

The bench tests showed that automatic synchronization of FES-IM to the Lokomat gait cycle was feasible and reliable. Automatic synchronization was more consistent than manually triggered stimulation (10-fold smaller standard deviation of latency), and produced no early or missed stimulations across 634 strides. Automatic synchronization had greater accuracy than manually triggered stimulation, producing stimulation timed to an accuracy of 2.5\% of one gait cycle duration (heel strike to heel strike = 100).},

Surprisingly, we found that the two basic patterns of stepping neonates are retained through development, augmented by two new patterns first revealed in toddlers. Markedly similar patterns were observed also in the rat, cat, macaque, and guineafowl, consistent with the hypothesis that, despite substantial phylogenetic distances and morphological differences, locomotion in several animal species is built starting from common primitives, perhaps related to a common ancestral neural network.},

Body-worn inertial sensor based gait analyses provide a feasible alternative to optometric and pressure based measurements of spatiotemporal gait characteristics. We assessed validity and relative and absolute reliability of a body-worn inertial sensor system (RehaGait{\textregistered}) for measuring spatiotemporal gait characteristics compared to a standard stationary treadmill (Zebris{\textregistered}). Spatiotemporal gait parameters (walking speed, stride length, cadence and stride time) were collected for 24 healthy seniors (age: 75.3~{\textpm}~6.7 years) tested on 2 days (1 week apart) simultaneously using the sensor based system and instrumented treadmill. Each participant completed walking tests (200 strides) at different walking speeds and slopes. The difference between the RehaGait{\textregistered}system and the treadmill was trivial (Cohen's d~{$<$}0.2) except for speed and stride length at slow speed (Cohen's d, 0.35 and 0.49, respectively). Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were excellent for temporal gait characteristics (cadence and stride time; ICC: 0.99--1.00) and moderate for stride length (ICC: 0.73--0.89). Both devices had excellent day-to-day reliability for all gait parameters (ICC: 0.82--0.99) except for stride length at slow speed (ICC: 0.74). The RehaGait{\textregistered}is a valid and reliable tool for assessing spatiotemporal gait parameters for treadmill walking at different speeds and slopes.},

  abstract = {In human walking, the center of mass motion is similar to an inverted pendulum. Viewing double support as a transition from one inverted pendulum to the next, we hypothesized that the leading leg performs negative work to redirect the center of mass velocity, while simultaneously, the trailing leg performs positive work to replace the lost energy. To test this hypothesis, we developed a method to quantify the external mechanical work performed by each limb (individual limbs method). Traditional measures of external mechanical work use the sum of the ground reaction forces acting on the limbs (combined limbs method) allowing for the mathematical cancellation of simultaneous positive and negative work during multiple support periods. We expected to find that the traditional combined limbs method underestimates external mechanical work by a substantial amount. We used both methods to measure the external mechanical work performed by humans walking over a range of speeds. We found that during double support, the legs perform a substantial amount of positive and negative external work simultaneously. The combined limbs measures of positive and negative external work were approximately 33\% less than those calculated using the individual limbs method. At all speeds, the trailing leg performs greater than 97\% of the double support positive work while the leading leg performs greater than 94\% of the double support negative work. r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {In the single stance phase of walking, center of mass motion resembles that of an inverted pendulum. Theoretically, mechanical work is not necessary for producing the pendular motion, but work is needed to redirect the center of mass velocity from one pendular arc to the next during the transition between steps. A collision model predicts a rate of negative work proportional to the fourth power of step length. Positive work is required to restore the energy lost, potentially exacting a proportional metabolic cost. We tested these predictions with humans (N=9) walking over a range of step lengths (0.4-1.1 m) while keeping step frequency fixed at 1.8 Hz. We measured individual limb external mechanical work using force plates, and metabolic rate using indirect calorimetry. As predicted, average negative and positive external mechanical work rates increased with the fourth power of step length (from 1 W to 38 W; r2=0.96). Metabolic rate also increased with the fourth power of step length (from 7 W to 379 W; r2=0.95), and linearly with mechanical work rate. Mechanical work for step-to-step transitions, rather than pendular motion itself, appears to be a major determinant of the metabolic cost of walking.},

Results: Patients in both groups achieved statistically significant improvement. Participants in the intervention group revealed a significantly greater improvement in the shortening of the stance phase (p\,=\,0.0045) and lengthening of the swing phase of the unaffected limb (p\,=\,0.0042) and an increase in the unaffected limb cycle length (p\,=\,0.0021).

Design: Secondary analysis of 3-month outcomes for the Glycine Antagonist in Neuroprotection (GAIN) Americas randomized stroke trial. Setting: A multicenter randomized trial performed in 132 centers in the United States and Canada. Participants: A total of 696 individuals with stroke who were community-dwelling and independent prior to acute stroke. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Rasch analysis was performed using WINSTEPS, version 3.31, to evaluate 4 psychometric characteristics of the SIS: (1) unidimensionality or fit (the extent to which items measure a single construct), (2) targeting (the extent to which the items are of appropriate difficulty for the sample), (3) item difficulty (the ordering of items from least to most difficult to perform), and (4) separation (the extent to which the items distinguish distinct levels of functioning within the sample). Results: (1) Within each domain, most of the items measured a single construct. Only 3 items misfit the constructs and were deleted ("add and subtract numbers," "get up from a chair," "feel emotionally connected") and 2 items ("handle money," "manage money") misfit the combined physical domain. These items were deleted to create SIS, version 3.0. (2) Overall, the items are well targeted to the sample. The physical and participation domains have a wide range of items that capture difficulties that most individuals with stroke experience in physical and role functions, while the memory, emotion, and communication domains include items that capture limitations in the most impaired patients. (3) The order of items from less to more difficult was clinically meaningful. (4) The individual physical domains differentiated at least 3 (high, average, low) levels of functioning and the composite physical domain differentiated more than 4 levels of functioning. However, because difficulties with communication, memory, and emotion were not as frequently reported and difficulties with hand function were more frequently reported, these domains only differentiated 2 (high, low) to 3 (high, average, low) strata of patients. Time from stroke onset to administration of the SIS had little effect on item functioning. Conclusion: Rasch analysis further established the validity of the SIS. The domains are unidimensional, the items have an excellent range of difficulty, and the domain scores differentiated patients into multiple strata. The activities of daily living/instrumental activities of daily living, mobility, strength, composite physical, and participation domains have the most robust psychometric characteristics. The composite physical domain is most able to discriminate difficulty in function in individuals after stroke, while the communication, memory, and emotion domain items only capture limitations in function in the more impaired groups of patients. {\copyright} 2003 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.},

The effectiveness and appropriate timing of this intervention have not been established.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: We stratified 408 participants who had had a stroke 2 months earlier according to the extent of walking impairment--moderate (able to walk 0.4 to {$<$}0.8 m per second) or severe (able to walk {$<$}0.4 m per second)--and randomly assigned them to one of three training groups. One group received training on a treadmill with the use of body-weight support 2 months after the stroke had occurred (early locomotor training), the second group received this training 6 months after the stroke had occurred (late locomotor training), and the third group participated in an exercise program at home managed by a physical therapist 2 months after the stroke (home-exercise program). Each intervention included 36 sessions of 90 minutes each for 12 to 16 weeks. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants in each group who had an improvement in functional walking ability 1 year after the stroke.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: At 1 year, 52.0\% of all participants had increased functional walking ability. No significant differences in improvement were found between early locomotor training and home exercise (adjusted odds ratio for the primary outcome, 0.83; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.50 to 1.39) or between late locomotor training and home exercise (adjusted odds ratio, 1.19; 95\% CI, 0.72 to 1.99). All groups had similar improvements in walking speed, motor recovery, balance, functional status, and quality of life. Neither the delay in initiating the late locomotor training nor the severity of the initial impairment affected the outcome at 1 year. Ten related serious adverse events were reported (occurring in 2.2\% of participants undergoing early locomotor training, 3.5\% of those undergoing late locomotor training, and 1.6\% of those engaging in home exercise). As compared with the home-exercise group, each of the groups receiving locomotor training had a higher frequency of dizziness or faintness during treatment (P=0.008). Among patients with severe walking impairment, multiple falls were more common in the group receiving early locomotor training than in the other two groups (P=0.02).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Locomotor training, including the use of body-weight support in stepping on a treadmill, was not shown to be superior to progressive exercise at home managed by a physical therapist.

Elastic gaits can be either bilaterally symmetric (e.g. run and trot) or asymmetric (e.g. skip, canter and gallop), yet only symmetric pendular gaits (e.g. walk) are observed in nature. Does minimizing metabolic and mechanical power constrain pendular gaits to temporal symmetry? We measured rates of metabolic energy expenditure and calculated mechanical power production while healthy humans walked symmetrically and asymmetrically at a range of step and stride times. We found that walking with a 42 per cent step time asymmetry required 80 per cent (2.5 W kg(-1)) more metabolic power than preferred symmetric gait. Positive mechanical power production increased by 64 per cent (approx. 0.24 W kg(-1)), paralleling the increases we observed in metabolic power. We found that when walking asymmetrically, subjects absorbed more power during double support than during symmetric walking and compensated by increasing power production during single support. Overall, we identify inherent metabolic and mechanical costs to gait asymmetry and find that symmetry is optimal in healthy human walking.},

Impairments resulting from stroke lead to persistent difficulties with walking and subsequently, improved walking ability is one of the highest priorities for people living with a stroke. In addition, walking ability has important health implications in providing protective effects against secondary complications common after a stroke such as heart disease or osteoporosis. This paper systematically reviews common gait training strategies (neurodevelopmental techniques, muscle strengthening, treadmill training, intensive mobility exercises) to improve walking ability. The results (descriptive summaries as well as pooled effect sizes) from randomized controlled trials are presented and implications for optimal gait training strategies are discussed. Novel and emerging gait training strategies are highlighted and research directions proposed to enable the optimal recovery and maintenance of walking ability.},

  abstract = {Background. Regular physical activity is vital for cardiovascular health. Time spent in sedentary behaviors (eg, sitting, lying down) also is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The pattern in which sedentary time is accumulated is important---with prolonged periods of sitting time being particularly deleterious. People with stroke are at high risk for cardiovascular disease, including recurrent stroke. Purpose. This systematic review aimed to update current knowledge of physical activity and sedentary behaviors among people with stroke living in the community. A secondary aim was to investigate factors associated with physical activity levels. Data Sources. The data sources used were MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Allied and Complimentary Medicine Database (AMED), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Study Selection. Studies involving people with stroke living in the community and utilizing objective measures of physical activity or sedentary behaviors were included. Data Extraction. Data were extracted by one reviewer and checked for accuracy by a second person. Data Synthesis. Twenty-six studies, involving 983 participants, were included. The most common measure of activity was steps per day (22 studies), which was consistently reported as less than half of age-matched normative values. Only 4 studies reported on sedentary time specifically. No studies described the pattern by which sedentary behaviors were accumulated across the day. Walking ability, balance, and degree of physical fitness were positively associated with higher levels of physical activity. Limitations. This review included only studies of people living in the community after stroke who were able to walk, and the majority of included participants were aged between 65 and 75 years of age. C.

Metastability has been proposed as a principle of brain{\textasciitilde}behavior, and is captured in the extended or `broken-symmetry' version of the HKB model of coordination dynamics. The metastable regime of coordination dynamics reconciles the tendency of specialized brain regions to express autonomy (segregation) and their simultaneous tendency to work together as a synergetic whole (integration). There is growing evidence from recent studies in the brain and behavioral sciences that the complementary nature of integrating and segregating tendencies is essential to the way human brain{\textasciitilde}minds work.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Long-term use of a foot-drop stimulator applying functional electrical stimulation (FES) to the common peroneal nerve improves walking performance even when the stimulator is off. This "therapeutic" effect might result from neuroplastic changes. OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of long-term use of a foot-drop stimulator on residual corticospinal connections in people with central nervous system disorders. METHODS Ten people with nonprogressive disorders (eg, stroke) and 26 with progressive disorders (eg, multiple sclerosis) used a foot-drop stimulator for 3 to 12 months while walking in the community. Walking performance and electrophysiological variables were measured before and after FES use. From the surface electromyogram of the tibialis anterior muscle, we measured the following: (1) motor-evoked potential (MEP) from transcranial magnetic stimulation over the motor cortex, (2) maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), and (3) maximum motor wave (M(max)) from stimulating the common peroneal nerve. RESULTS After using FES, MEP and MVC increased significantly by comparable amounts, 50\% and 48\%, respectively, in the nonprogressive group and 27\% and 17\% in the progressive group; the changes were positively correlated (R(2) = .35; P {$<$} .001). Walking speed increased with the stimulator off (therapeutic effect) by 24\% (P = .008) and 7\% (P = .014) in the nonprogressive and progressive groups, respectively. The changes in M(max) were small and not correlated with changes in MEP. CONCLUSIONS The large increases in MVC and MEP suggest that regular use of a foot-drop stimulator strengthens activation of motor cortical areas and their residual descending connections, which may explain the therapeutic effect on walking speed.},

Subjects were assigned to 1 of 3 parallel arms for 12 weeks (6 weeks/device): arm 1 (WA-AFO), n = 38; arm 2 (AFO-WA), n = 31; arm 3 (AFO-AFO), n = 24. Primary outcomes were walking speed and Physiological Cost Index for the Figure-of-8 walking test. Secondary measures included 10-m walking speed and perceived safety during this test, general mobility, and device preference for arms 1 and 2 for continued use. Walking tests were performed with (On) and without a device (Off) at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 weeks.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Both WA and AFO had significant orthotic (On-Off difference), therapeutic (change over time when Off), and combined (change over time On vs baseline Off) effects on walking speed. An AFO also had a significant orthotic effect on Physiological Cost Index. The WA had a higher, but not significantly different therapeutic effect on speed than an AFO, whereas an AFO had a greater orthotic effect than the WA (significant at 12 weeks). Combined effects on speed after 6 weeks did not differ between devices. Users felt as safe with the WA as with an AFO, but significantly more users preferred the WA.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Both devices produce equivalent functional gains.},

Forty-one healthy adults ran multiple trials on an instrumented treadmill while wearing one inertial measurement unit on the dorsum of each foot. Different algorithms for the detection of initial contact and terminal contact were proposed, evaluated and compared with a reference-threshold on the vertical ground reaction force. The minimum of the pitch angular velocity within the first and second half of a mid-swing to mid-swing cycle were identified as the most precise features for initial and terminal contact detection with an inter-trial median {\textpm} IQR precision of 2 {\textpm} 1 ms and 4 {\textpm} 2 ms respectively. Using these initial and terminal contact features, this study showed that the ground contact time, flight time, step and swing time can be estimated with an inter-trial median {\textpm} IQR bias less than 12 {\textpm} 10 ms and the a precision less than 4 {\textpm} 3 ms. Finally, this study showed that the running speed can significantly affect the biases of the estimations, suggesting that a speed-dependent correction should be applied to improve the system's accuracy.},

For orthoses that control the knee, an ideal system would only locate sensors at the thigh and knee, thereby facilitating sensor and electronics integration with the assistive device. To determine potential gait phase identification approaches, classification was implemented using J-48 Decision Tree, Random Forest, Multi-layer Perceptrons, and Support Vector Machine classifiers, along with 5-fold (5-FCV) and 10-fold cross validation (10-FCV). Knee angle, thigh angular velocity, and thigh acceleration were obtained from 31 able-bodied participants during walking (10 strides each). Strides were segmented into Loading Response, Push-Off, Swing, and Terminal Swing and features were extracted using a 0.1 second sliding window. Gait phase classification was performed with and without the knee angle parameter. J-48 Decision Tree with the knee angle parameter was ranked the best classifier due to its second highest classification accuracy of 97.5\% and lowest mean absolute error of 0.014. Results without the knee angle parameter differed by only 0.5\% and 0.003. Therefore, an inertial sensor with accelerometer and gyroscope output, located at the thigh, is a viable approach for classifying gait phases for intelligent orthosis control.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous reports of the mechanics and energetics of post-stroke hemiparetic walking have either not combined estimates of mechanical and metabolic energy or computed external mechanical work based on the limited combined limbs method. Here we present a comparison of the mechanics and energetics of hemiparetic and unimpaired walking at a matched speed. METHODS: Mechanical work done on the body centre of mass (COM) was computed by the individual limbs method and work done at individual leg joints was computed with an inverse dynamics analysis. Both estimates were converted to average powers and related to simultaneous estimates of net metabolic power, determined via indirect calorimetry. Efficiency of positive work was calculated as the ratio of average positive mechanical power [Formula: see text] to net metabolic power. RESULTS: Total [Formula: see text] was 20\% greater for the hemiparetic group (H) than for the unimpaired control group (C) (0.49 vs. 0.41 W . kg(-1)). The greater [Formula: see text] was partly attributed to the paretic limb of hemiparetic walkers not providing appropriately timed push-off [Formula: see text] in the step-to-step transition. This led to compensatory non-paretic limb hip and knee [Formula: see text] which resulted in greater total mechanical work. Efficiency of positive work was not different between H and C. CONCLUSIONS: Increased work, not decreased efficiency, explains the greater metabolic cost of hemiparetic walking post-stroke. Our results highlighted the need to target improving paretic ankle push-off via therapy or assistive technology in order to reduce the metabolic cost of hemiparetic walking.},

This study tested the hypothesis that less knee extension angle and less posterior displacement of the femur relative to the tibia during the heel-strike portion of the gait cycle are associated with greater loss of medial cartilage thickness during a follow-up period of five years. This study also tested for associations between flexion-extension angle and anterior-posterior displacement during other periods of the gait cycle and 5-year cartilage thinning. 16 subjects with moderate medial knee OA were tested with gait analysis and MRI at baseline and had a follow-up MRI after 5 years. Linear regressions were used to assess the relationship between changes in cartilage thickness and baseline kinematics using Pearson correlation coefficients. Multivariate regressions were also performed to adjust for gender, baseline age, BMI, walking speed, Kellgren/Lawrence grade, and baseline knee pain score. As hypothesized, baseline knee flexion angle and femoral displacement during heel-strike and other gait cycle periods were significantly associated with medial femoral and tibial cartilage thinning at the 5 year follow-up; these associations were strengthened after adjustment for covariates. This study provided new insight into the pathogenesis of knee OA where baseline knee kinematics were associated with longitudinal disease progression. These results could serve as a basis for developing newer gait modification interventions to reduce the risk for developing knee OA.},

Main outcome measures Modified Ashworth Scale, Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA), Motor Status Scale (MSS) score, and Medical Research Council motor power score. Results No significant differences were found among pretreatment clinical evaluations. Statistically significant gains from admission to discharge and from admission to follow-up (P{$<$}.05) were found on the FMA, MSS score for shoulder and elbow, and motor power score. Conclusions Short-term, goal-directed robotic therapy can significantly improve motor abilities of the exercised limb segments in persons with chronic stroke that are sustained 4 months after discharge. This suggests that motor recovery can be enhanced by repetitive exercise training more than 1 year after stroke. {\copyright} 2004 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.},

The ability of modern data science methods to extract insights from large, complex, heterogeneous, and noisy datasets is beginning to provide a powerful complement to the traditional approaches of experimental motion capture and biomechanical modeling. The purpose of this article is to provide a perspective on how data science methods can be incorporated into our field to advance our understanding of gait biomechanics and improve treatment planning procedures. We provide examples of how data science approaches have been applied to biomechanical data. We then discuss the challenges that remain for effectively using data science approaches in clinical gait analysis and gait biomechanics research, including the need for new tools, better infrastructure and incentives for sharing data, and education across the disciplines of biomechanics and data science. By addressing these challenges, we can revolutionize treatment planning and biomechanics research by capitalizing on the wealth of knowledge gained by gait researchers over the past decades and the vast, but often siloed, data that are collected in clinical and research laboratories around the world.},

Machine learning approaches are mainly applied due to their ability to work with multidimensional nonlinear features. Purpose: to compare several machine learning algorithms employed for gait pattern recognition in motor disorders using discriminant features extracted from gait dynamics. Additionally, this work highlights procedures that improve gait recognition performance. Methods: we conducted an electronic literature search on Web of Science, IEEE, and Scopus, using ``human recognition'', ``gait patterns'', and ``feature selection methods'' as relevant keywords. Results: analysis of the literature showed that kernel principal component analysis and genetic algorithms are efficient at reducing dimensional features due to their ability to process nonlinear data and converge to global optimum. Comparative analysis of machine learning performance showed that support vector machines (SVMs) exhibited higher accuracy and proper generalization for new instances. Conclusions: automatic recognition by combining dimensional data reduction, cross-validation and normalization techniques with SVMs may offer an objective and rapid tool for investigating the subject's clinical status. Future directions comprise the real-time application of these tools to drive powered assistive devices in free-living conditions.},

BACKGROUND: The quadriceps angle is said to be relevant in the etiology and management of patello-femoral pain. However, the issues around measurement accuracy have not been reported. METHODS: Errors between 1 and 5 mm were introduced to the medial/lateral and vertical co-ordinate data describing the position of the anterior superior iliac spine, the centre of the patella and the centre of the tibial tuberosity, and the effect on the quadriceps angle determined. RESULTS: Errors between 1 and 5 mm in the medial/lateral location of the centre of the patella produced changes in the quadriceps angle between 1.13 degrees and 5.53 degrees. Errors between 1 and 5 mm in the medial/lateral location of the tibial tuberosity produced changes in the quadriceps angle between 1.02 degrees and 5.18 degrees. CONCLUSIONS: The quadriceps angle is highly sensitive to error in the definition of the centre of the patella and tibial tuberosity. As an approximation, these centres need to be defined with an accuracy of less than 2 mm if the error in the quadriceps angle is to remain below 5 degrees. RELEVANCE: Until a clinical technique for measuring the quadriceps angle with a high level of accuracy is developed, the clinical use of the quadriceps angle is questionable.},

The aim of this study is to evaluate if the energy cost of walking (CW), in a mixed group of chronic patients with neurological diseases almost 6 months after discharge from rehabilitation wards, can predict the walking performance and any walking restriction on community activities, as indicated by Walking Handicap Scale categories (WHS). One hundred and seven subjects were included in the study, 31 suffering from Stroke, 26 from Spinal Cord Injury and 50 from Multiple Sclerosis. The multivariable binary logistical regression analysis has produced a statistical model with good characteristics of fit and good predictability. This model generated a cut-off value of.40, which enabled us to classify correctly the cases with a percentage of 85.0\%. Our research reveal that, in our subjects, CW is the only predictor of the walking performance of in the community, to be compared with the score of WHS. We have been also identifying a cut-off value of CW cost, which makes a distinction between those who can walk in the community and those who cannot do it. In particular, these values could be used to predict the ability to walk in the community when discharged from the rehabilitation units, and to adjust the rehabilitative treatment to improve the performance.},

  abstract = {Walking uphill and downhill can be challenging for community-dwelling old adults. We investigated the effects of age on leg muscle activity amplitudes and timing during level, uphill, and downhill walking. We hypothesized that old adults would exhibit smaller increases in ankle extensor muscle activities and greater increases in hip extensor muscle activities compared to young adults during uphill vs. level walking. We also hypothesized that, compared to level walking, antagonist leg muscle coactivation would be disproportionately greater in old vs. young adults during downhill walking. Ten old (72 {\AE} 5 yrs) and ten young (25 {\AE} 4 yrs) subjects walked at 1.25 m/s on a treadmill at seven grades (08, {\AE}38, {\AE}68, {\AE}98). We quantified the stance phase electromyographic activities of the gluteus maximus (GMAX), biceps femoris (BF), rectus femoris (RF), vastus medialis (VM), medial gastrocnemius (MG), soleus (SOL), and tibialis anterior (TA). Old adults exhibited smaller increases in MG activity with steeper uphill grade than young adults (e.g., +136\% vs. +174\% at 98). A disproportionate recruitment of hip muscles led to GMAX activity approaching the maximum isometric capacity of these active old adults at steep uphill grades (e.g., old vs. young, 73\% MVC vs. 33\% MVC at +98). Neither uphill nor downhill walking affected the greater coactivation of antagonist muscles in old vs. young adults. We conclude that the disproportionate recruitment of hip muscles with advanced age may have critical implications for maintaining independent mobility in old adults, particularly at steeper uphill grades.},

Here, we investigated how advanced age alters individual leg mechanics during level, uphill, and downhill walking. We hypothesized that, compared to young adults, old adults would exhibit: (1) reduced trailing leg propulsive ground reaction forces (GRFs) and positive work rates during uphill walking, and (2) reduced leading leg braking ground reaction forces and negative work rates during downhill walking. We calculated the individual leg mechanical work performed by 10 old (mean 7SD, age: 72 7 5 yrs) and 11 young (age: 267 5 yrs) adults walking at 1.25 m/s on a dual-belt force-measuring treadmill at seven grades (01 and 7 31, 7 61, 7 91). As hypothesized, old adults exhibited significantly reduced propulsive GRFs (e.g., {\`A} 21\% at {\th} 91) and average trailing leg positive work rates (e.g., {\`A} 26\% at {\th}91) compared to young adults during both level and uphill walking. Old adults compensated by performing greater positive work than young adults during the subsequent single support phase. In contrast, we reject our second hypothesis. We found no differences in braking GRFs or negative work rates between old and young adults. However, old adults exhibited significantly reduced second peak perpendicular GRFs during downhill walking compared to young adults. Our findings most notably identify how advanced age may impair uphill walking ability and thus independence and quality of life.},

We hypothesized that: (1) old adults would exhibit smaller peak ankle joint kinetics and larger peak hip joint kinetics than young adults during both level and uphill walking and (2) these age-related differences in ankle and hip joint kinetics would be greatest during uphill vs. level walking. We quantified the sagittal plane ankle, knee, and hip joint kinetics of 10 old adults (mean {\AE} SD, age: 72 {\AE} 5 yrs) and 8 young adults (age: 27 {\AE} 5 yrs) walking at 1.25 m/s on a dual-belt, force-measuring treadmill at four grades (08, +38, +68, +98). As hypothesized, old adults walked with smaller peak ankle joint kinetics (e.g., power generation: {\`A}18\% at +98) and larger peak hip joint kinetics (e.g., power generation: +119\% at +98) than young adults, most evident during the late stance phase of both level and uphill conditions. Old adults performed two to three times more single support positive work than young adults via muscles crossing the knee. In partial support of our second hypothesis, the age-related reduction in peak ankle joint moments was greater during uphill ({\`A}0.41 Nm/kg) vs. level ({\`A}0.30 Nm/kg) walking. However, old adults that exhibited reduced propulsive ankle function during level walking could perform 44\% more trailing leg positive ankle joint work to walk uphill. Our findings indicate that maintaining ankle power generation and trailing leg propulsive function should be the primary focus of ``prehabilitation'' strategies for old adults to preserve their uphill walking ability.},

The purpose of this study was to reexamine factors that predict home and community ambulators determined from real-world walking activity data using activity monitors. METHODS Secondary analyses of real-world walking activity from 2 stroke trials. Home (100-2499 steps/d), most limited community (2500-4499 steps/d), least limited community (5000-74 999), and full community ({$\geq$}7500 steps/d) walking categories were developed based on normative data. Independent variables to predict walking categories were comfortable and fast gait speed, 6-minute walk test, Berg Balance Scale, Fugl Meyer, and Stroke Impact Scale. Data were analyzed using multivariate analyses to identify significant variables associated with walking categories, bootstrap method to select the most stable model and receiver-operating characteristic to identify cutoff values. RESULTS Data from 441 individuals poststroke were analyzed. The 6-minute walk test, Fugl Meyer, and Berg Balance Scale combined were the strongest predictors of home versus community and limited versus unlimited community ambulators. The 6-minute walk test was the strongest individual variable in predicting home versus community (receiver-operating characteristic area under curve=0.82) and limited versus full community ambulators (receiver-operating characteristic area under curve=0.76). A comfortable gait speed of 0.49 m/s discriminated between home and community and a comfortable gait speed of 0.93 m/s discriminated between limited community and full community ambulators. CONCLUSIONS The 6-minute walk test was better able to discriminate among home, limited community, and full community ambulators than comfortable gait speed. Gait speed values commonly used to distinguish between home and community walkers may overestimate walking activity.},

  abstract = {The International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) is a framework for describing and organising information on functioning and disability. It provides a standard language and a conceptual basis for the definition and measurement of health and disability. The ICF was approved for use by the World Health Assembly in 2001, after extensive testing across the world involving people with disabilities and people from a range of relevant disciplines. A companion classification for children and youth (ICF-CY) was published in 2007. The ICF integrates the major models of disability. It recognises the role of environmental factors in the creation of disability, as well as the relevance of associated health conditions and their effects. This overview provides a brief introduction to the ICF --- its structure, contents, purposes and applications. Aims The ICF is a multipurpose classification system designed to serve various disciplines and sectors --- for example in education and transportation as well as in health and community services --- and across different countries and cultures. The aims of the ICF (WHO 2001:5) are to: {$\bullet$} provide a scientific basis for understanding and studying health and health-related states, outcomes, determinants, and changes in health status and functioning; {$\bullet$} establish a common language for describing health and health-related states in order to improve communication between different users, such as health care workers, researchers, policy-makers and the public, including people with disabilities; {$\bullet$} permit comparison of data across countries, health care disciplines, services and time; and {$\bullet$} provide a systematic coding scheme for health information systems. The ICF 'has been accepted as one of the United Nations social classifications {\dots} and {\dots} provides an appropriate instrument for the implementation of stated international human rights mandates as well as national legislation' (WHO 2001:5-6). Hence, the ICF provides a valuable framework for monitoring aspects of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN 2006), as well as for national and international policy formulation. Underlying principles Four general principles guided the development of the ICF and are essential to its application. Universality. A classification of functioning and disability should be applicable to all people irrespective of health condition and in all physical, social and cultural contexts. The ICF achieves this and acknowledges that anyone can experience some disability. It concerns everyone's functioning and disability, and was not designed, nor should be used, to label persons with disabilities as a separate social group. Parity and aetiological neutrality. In classifying functioning and disability, there is not an explicit or implicit distinction between different health conditions, whether 'mental' or 'physical'. In other words, disability is not differentiated by aetiology. By shifting the focus from health condition to functioning, it places all health conditions on an equal footing, allowing them to be compared using a common metric. Further, it clarifies that we cannot infer participation in everyday life from diagnosis alone.},

METHOD: A convenience sample included 162 preschool children with autism ages 36 to 72 months. The raters collected data using the ICF-CY-based questionnaire as an instrument to construct the structural equation modeling of factors associated with participation. RESULTS: The internal structure of the model was acceptable, indicating that the observed variables would suffice in accounting for latent variables. The structural model showed that the performance of participation in children with autism was influenced by body functions and personal factors. All the variables accounted for 77\% of the explained variance for activities and for participation by 71\% of the children with autism. CONCLUSION: These findings may provide critical information pertaining to predictive factors of participation for parents, educators, and professionals who work with children with autism.},

  abstract = {Many real life tasks that require impedance control to minimize motion error are characterized by multiple solutions where the task can be performed either by co-contracting muscle groups, which requires a large effort, or, conversely, by relaxing muscles. However, human motor optimization studies have focused on tasks that are always satisfied by increasing impedance and that are characterized by a single error-effort optimum. To investigate motor optimization in the presence of multiple solutions and hence optima, we introduce a novel paradigm that enables us to let subjects repetitively (but inconspicuously) use different solutions and observe how exploration of multiple solutions affect their motor behavior. The results show that the behavior is largely influenced by motor memory with subjects tending to involuntarily repeat a recent suboptimal task-satisfying solution even after sufficient experience of the optimal solution. This suggests that the CNS does not optimize co-activation tasks globally but determines the motor behavior in a tradeoff of motor memory, error, and effort minimization.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the literature relating to the biofeedback used in physical rehabilitation. The biofeedback methods used in rehabilitation are based on biomechanical measurements and measurements of the physiological systems of the body. The physiological systems of the body which can be measured to provide biofeedback are the neuromuscular system, the respiratory system and the cardiovascular system. Neuromuscular biofeedback methods include electromyography (EMG) biofeedback and real-time ultrasound imaging (RTUS) biofeedback. EMG biofeedback is the most widely investigated method of biofeedback and appears to be effective in the treatment of many musculoskeletal conditions and in post cardiovascular accident (CVA) rehabilitation. RTUS biofeedback has been demonstrated effective in the treatment of low back pain (LBP) and pelvic floor muscle dysfunction. Cardiovascular biofeedback methods have been shown to be effective in the treatment of a number of health conditions such as hypertension, heart failure, asthma, fibromyalgia and even psychological disorders however a systematic review in this field has yet to be conducted. Similarly, the number of large scale studies examining the use of respiratory biofeedback in rehabilitation is limited. Measurements of movement, postural control and force output can be made using a number of different devices and used to deliver biomechanical biofeedback. Inertial based sensing biofeedback is the most widely researched biomechanical biofeedback method, with a number of studies showing it to be effective in improving measures of balance in a number of populations. Other types of biomechanical biofeedback include force plate systems, electrogoniometry, pressure biofeedback and camera based systems however the evidence for these is limited. Biofeedback is generally delivered using visual displays, acoustic or haptic signals, however more recently virtual reality (VR) or exergaming technology have been used as biofeedback signals. VR and exergaming technology have been primarily investigated in post-CVA rehabilitation, however, more recent work has shown this type of biofeedback to be effective in improving exercise technique in musculoskeletal populations. While a number of studies in this area have been conducted, further large scale studies and reviews investigating different biofeedback applications in different clinical populations are required.},

Design: The initial deficit on admission to rehabilitation was quantified by comparing 42 stroke patients with 42 controls matched by gender and age. The change in the stroke patients during the next 8 weeks was quantified and gait outcome was compared with functional and normal criteria. Setting: Patients were referred from four inpatient rehabilitation centers at the time of admission following a median of 16.5 days in the acute hospital. Patients: Selection criteria: ability to give informed consent; unilateral first stroke; ability to walk 10 meters. Intervention: Patients participated in a median of 17.38 hours of individual physical therapy including a median of 6.92 hours of gait training during the 8 weeks. Main Outcome Measure: Gait velocity. Results: Gait velocity was initially 38.6\% (26.71rdmin SD = 14.9) of the performance of controls and improved to 55.1\% (38.Ira/rain). At outcome only 24\% exceeded the 5th percentile of controls (48.1m/rain) or the velocity required to cross the typical signalled intersection (46.2m/rain). The change was only 26\% of the initial deficit. Fifty-five percent of the patients improved beyond the 95\% confidence intervals surrounding the error of measuring change. Indices of responsiveness indicated that there was a high signal-to-noise ratio and a robust effect size. Conclusion: Gait velocity discriminated the effect of stroke and the change during rehabilitation. {\copyright} 1996 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation},

An independent experiment was conducted to compare the results of our algorithms with those obtained from a Digimax force platform. The results show small deviations from times of occurrence of events recorded from the platform (13 {\AE} 35 ms for IC and 9 {\AE} 54 ms for FC). Results for the FC timing are especially relevant in this field, as no previous work has addressed its temporal location through the processing of lower trunk accelerations. The delay in the real-time detection of the IC is 117 {\AE} 39 ms and 34 {\AE} 72 ms for the FC, improving previously reported results for real-time detection of events from lower trunk accelerations.},

  abstract = {Context: A dynamic postural-control task that has gained notoriety in the clinical and research settings is the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT). Researchers have suggested that, with appropriate instruction and practice by the individual and normalization of the reaching distances, the SEBT can be used to provide objective measures to differentiate deficits and improvements in dynamic postural-control related to lower extremity injury and induced fatigue, and it has the potential to predict lower extremity injury. However, no one has reviewed this body of literature to determine the usefulness of the SEBT in clinical applications. Objective: To provide a narrative review of the SEBT and its implementation and the known contributions to task performance and to systematically review the associated literature to address the SEBT's usefulness as a clinical tool for the quantification of dynamic postural-control deficits from lower extremity impairment. Data Sources: Databases used to locate peer-reviewed articles published from 1980 and 2010 included Derwent Innovations Index, BIOSIS Previews, Journal Citation Reports, and MEDLINE. Study Selection: The criteria for article selection were (1) The study was original research. (2) The study was written in English. (3) The SEBT was used as a measurement tool. Data Extraction: Specific data extracted from the articles included the ability of the SEBT to differentiate pathologic conditions of the lower extremity, the effects of external influences and interventions, and outcomes from exercise intervention and to predict lower extremity injury. Data Synthesis: More than a decade of research findings has established a comprehensive portfolio of validity for the SEBT, and it should be considered a highly representative, noninstrumented dynamic balance test for physically active individuals. The SEBT has been shown to be a reliable measure and has validity as a dynamic test to predict risk of lower extremity injury, to identify dynamic balance deficits in patients with a variety of lower extremity conditions, and to be responsive to training programs in both healthy people and people with injuries to the lower extremity. Clinicians and researchers should be confident in employing the SEBT as a lower extremity functional test.},

  abstract = {Human movement models often divide movements into parts. In walking, the stride can be segmented into four different parts, and in golf and other sports, the swing is divided into sections based on the primary direction of motion. These parts are often divided based on key events, also called temporal parameters. When analyzing a movement, it is important to correctly locate these key events, and so automated techniques are needed. There exist many methods for dividing specific actions using data from specific sensors, but for new sensors or sensing positions, new techniques must be developed. We introduce a generic method for temporal parameter extraction called the hidden Markov event model based on hidden Markov models. Our method constrains the state structure to facilitate precise location of key events. This method can be quickly adapted to new movements and new sensors/sensor placements. Furthermore, it generalizes well to subjects not used for training. A multiobjective optimization technique using genetic algorithms is applied to decrease error and increase cross-subject generalizability. Further, collaborative techniques are explored. We validate this method on a walking dataset by using inertial sensors placed on various locations on a human body. Our technique is designed to be computationally complex for training, but computationally simple at runtime to allow deployment on resource-constrained sensor nodes.},

  abstract = {Feedback perturbation studies of speech acoustics have revealed a great deal about how speakers monitor and control their productions of segmental (e.g., formant frequencies) and non-segmental (e.g., pitch) linguistic elements. The majority of previous work, however, overlooks the role of acoustic feedback in consonant production and makes use of acoustic manipulations that effect either entire utterances or the entire acoustic signal, rather than more temporally and phonetically restricted alterations. This study, therefore, seeks to expand the feedback perturbation literature by examining perturbation of consonant acoustics that is applied in a time-restricted and phonetically specific manner. The spectral center of the alveopalatal fricative [{$\int$}] produced in vowel-fricative-vowel nonwords was incrementally raised until it reached the potential for [s]-like frequencies, but the characteristics of high-frequency energy outside the target fricative remained unaltered. An "offline," more widely accessible signal processing method was developed to perform this manipulation. The local feedback perturbation resulted in changes to speakers' fricative production that were more variable, idiosyncratic, and restricted than the compensation seen in more global acoustic manipulations reported in the literature. Implications and interpretations of the results, as well as future directions for research based on the findings, are discussed.},

  abstract = {Measurement of the ground reaction forces (GRF) during walking is typically limited to laboratory settings, and only short observations using wearable pressure insoles have been reported so far. In this study, a new proxy measurement method is proposed to estimate the vertical component of the GRF (vGRF) from wearable accelerometer signals. The accelerations are used as the proxy variable. An orthogonal forward regression algorithm (OFR) is employed to identify the dynamic relationships between the proxy variables and the measured vGRF using pressure-sensing insoles. The obtained model, which represents the connection between the proxy variable and the vGRF, is then used to predict the latter. The results have been validated using pressure insoles data collected from nine healthy individuals under two outdoor walking tasks in non-laboratory settings. The results show that the vGRFs can be reconstructed with high accuracy (with an average prediction error of less than 5.0\%) using only one wearable sensor mounted at the waist (L5, fifth lumbar vertebra). Proxy measures with different sensor positions are also discussed. Results show that the waist acceleration-based proxy measurement is more stable with less inter-task and inter-subject variability than the proxy measures based on forehead level accelerations. The proposed proxy measure provides a promising low-cost method for monitoring ground reaction forces in real-life settings and introduces a novel generic approach for replacing the direct determination of difficult to measure variables in many applications.},

To harness the power of these data and make research more efficient, modern machine learning techniques are starting to complement traditional statistical tools. This survey summarizes the current usage of machine learning methods in human movement biomechanics and highlights best practices that will enable critical evaluation of the literature. We carried out a PubMed/Medline database search for original research articles that used machine learning to study movement biomechanics in patients with musculoskeletal and neuromuscular diseases. Most studies that met our inclusion criteria focused on classifying pathological movement, predicting risk of developing a disease, estimating the effect of an intervention, or automatically recognizing activities to facilitate out-of-clinic patient monitoring. We found that research studies build and evaluate models inconsistently, which motivated our discussion of best practices. We provide recommendations for training and evaluating machine learning models and discuss the potential of several underutilized approaches, such as deep learning, to generate new knowledge about human movement. We believe that cross-training biomechanists in data science and a cultural shift toward sharing of data and tools are essential to maximize the impact of biomechanics research.},

Methods: Based on literature on provider-patient communication. Results: Offers, and discusses, five definitions of the term "theoretical" as it applies to empirical research and its exposition: (1) grounding, (2) referencing, (3) design and analysis, (4) interpretation, and (5) impact. Each of these definitions embodies a different standard for evaluating the theoretical aspects of research. Conclusion: Although it is often said that research on provider-patient communication is not "theoretical" enough, the term is ambiguous and often applied vaguely. A multidimensional analysis reveals that there are several distinct ways in which empirical research can be strong or weak theoretically. Practice implications: Researchers, educators, editors, and reviewers could use the "Five Ways" framework to appraise the theory-relevant strengths and weaknesses of empirical research and its exposition. {\copyright} 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

  abstract = {Real-time gait event detection is a requirement for functional electrical stimulation and gait biofeedback. This gait event detection should ideally be achieved using an ambulatory system of durable, lightweight, low-cost sensors. Previous research has reported issues with durability in footswitch systems. Therefore, this study describes the development and assessment of novel detection algorithms using footswitch and accelerometer sensors on 12 healthy individuals. Subjects were equipped with one force sensitive resistor on the heel, one accelerometer at the foot, and one accelerometer at the knee. Subjects performed 10, 8-m walking trials in each of three conditions: normal, slow, and altered (reduced knee ROM) walking. Data from a subset of four subjects were used to develop prediction algorithms for initial contact (IC). Subsequently, these algorithms were tested on the remaining eight subjects against standard forceplate IC data (threshold of 5 N on a rising edge). The footswitch force threshold algorithm was most accurate for IC detection (mean absolute error of 2.4 {\AE} 2.1 ms) and was significantly more accurate (p {$<$} 0.001) than the optimal accelerometer algorithm (mean absolute error of 9.5 {\AE} 9.0 ms). The optimal accelerometer algorithm used data from both accelerometers, with IC determined from the second derivative of foot fore-aft acceleration. The error results for footswitch and accelerometer algorithms are lower (\$60\%) than in previous research on ambulatory real-time gait event detection systems. Currently, footswitch systems must be recommended over accelerometer systems for accurate detection of IC, however, further research into accelerometer algorithms is merited due to its advantages as a durable, low-cost sensor. {\ss} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Analysis of each of the phase locked trials revealed distinct preferences for particular 4-legged patterns, with interpersonal in- and anti-phase coordination patterns (equitable with quadruped pace and trot, respectively) observed almost exclusively. Preference for either pattern depended on the strength of coupling. The authors discuss these findings in light of previous claims that the patterns of human and animal locomotion---as well as coordinated movements in general---can emerge from lawful coupling relations that exist between the subcomponents of perceptual-motor systems.},

Conceived as complex adaptive behavior, dexterity depends upon the qualities of robustness and degeneracy, and is supported by the functional complexity of the agent-environment system. Using Bernstein's and Gibson's ecological analyses of behavior situated in natural environments as conceptual touchstones, we consider the hypothesis that complex adaptive behavior capitalizes upon general principles of self-organization. Here, we outline a perspective in which the complex interactivity of nervous-system, body, and environment is revealed as an essential resource for adaptive behavior. From this perspective, we consider the implications for interpreting the functionality and dysfunctionality of human behavior. This paper demonstrates that, optimal variability, the topic of this special issue, is a logical consequence of interpreting the functionality of human behavior as complex adaptive behavior.},

Design: Cross-sectional, intact groups research design. Setting: Biomechanics research laboratory. Participants: Forty-three patients were stratified into 2 groups based on the Hoehn and Yahr (H\&Y) disability score, which heavily favors balance in determining disability. The 2 groups were: H\&Y score of 2.0 or less (nϭ23; age, 61Ϯ10y) or H\&Y score of 2.5 or higher (nϭ20; age, 70Ϯ9y). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: The peak COP-COM distance represents the maximum separation between the location of the whole-body COM and the ground reaction force's COP, and thus is an indicator of dynamic balance control. The peak COP-COM was evaluated during 3 phases of the COP trajectory during a gait initiation task. Results: The peak magnitude of the COP-COM distance was significantly greater during the end of the single-support phase in the less disabled patients (H\&Y score Յ2.0) than in more balance disabled patients (H\&Y score Ն2.5) (Pϭ.004). Conclusions: The differences in COP-COM distances between these H\&Y groups suggest that patients with PD who have impaired postural control produce shorter COM-COP distances than do persons without clinically detectable balance impairment. This method of evaluation could prove a useful quantitative index to examine the impact of interventions designed to improve ambulation and balance in PD.},

Thus, the purpose of this study was to examine the potential benefits PRT on GI performance in people with Parkinson's disease. Eighteen individuals with idiopathic PD were randomly assigned to either a twice weekly PRT program or a non-contact control group for 10 weeks. Biomechanical analysis of GI was performed pre- and post-intervention. Dependent variables of interest included the displacement of the center-of-pressure (COP) during the anticipatory postural phase of GI as well as the initial stride length and velocity. The PRT group demonstrated improvements in the posterior displacement of the COP and the initial stride length and velocity. There were no improvements in any variables for the control subjects. These results suggest that PRT may be an effective non-pharmacological and nonsurgical treatment to improve GI performance in PWP.},

Whole body kinematics and ground reactions were recorded for 21 healthy young (21--32 y) and 20 healthy older adults (66--81 y) walking at 80\%, 100\% and 120\% of preferred speed. The limb-induced COM accelerations and the work done on the COM by the limbs were computed. Despite walking with similar gait speeds, older adults did significantly (p {$<$} 0.05) less positive work on the COM during push-off but then performed more positive work on the COM during midstance. As a result, older adults induced lower tri-axial COM accelerations via the trailing limb and higher vertical COM acceleration via the leading limb during double support. Older adults also reduced the mediolateral COM acceleration induced by the leading limb during the last third of double support. The forward and vertical components of the limb-induced COM accelerations were highly correlated (p {$<$} 0.005) but were not correlated to the mediolateral component during double support, at any speed. Together, these results suggest that older adults use the leading limb to compensate for reduced vertical support and work done by the trailing limb.

  abstract = {Increased practice difficulty during asymmetrical split-belt treadmill rehabilitation has been shown to improve gait outcomes during retention and transfer tests. However, research in this area has been limited by manual treadmill operation. In the case of variable practice, which requires stride-by-stride changes to treadmill belt velocities, the treadmill control must be automated. This paper presents a method for automation of asymmetrical split-belt treadmill walking, and evaluates how well this method performs with regards to timing of gait events. One participant walked asymmetrically for 100 strides, where the nondominant limb was driven at their self-selected walking speed, while the other limb was driven randomly on a stride-by-stride basis. In the control loop, the key factors to insure that the treadmill belt had accelerated to its new velocity safely during the swing phase were the sampling rate of the A/D converter, processing time within the controller software, and acceleration of the treadmill belt. The combination of these three factors resulted in a total control loop time during each swing phase that satisfied these requirements with a factor of safety that was greater than 4. Further, a polynomial fit indicated that belt acceleration was the largest contributor to changes in this total time. This approach appears to be safe and reliable for stride-by-stride adjustment of treadmill belt speed, making it suitable for future asymmetrical split-belt walking studies. Further, it can be incorporated into virtual reality rehabilitation paradigms that utilize split-belt treadmill walking.},

EMG data was collected from 14 muscles in two groups of healthy young subjects who walked at five different speeds ranging from 0.75 to 1.75 ms-1. We found that average EMG profiles varied in a predictable way with speed. The average EMG profile for each muscle at any speed could be estimated in a simple way from two functions, one constant and one proportionally increasing with walking speed. By taking into account the similarity among profiles within functional groups, the number of basic functions could be reduced further. Any average EMG profile among the 14 leg muscles studied at all speeds in the measured range could be predicted from six constant and ten speed-dependent basic patterns. These results can be interpreted in terms of a central pattern generator for human walking. {\copyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Using a rigid, rod-shaped testing device, CMA laboratory data are collected simultaneously from the FP and motion capture components (typically, video-based kinematic measurements) as the device is manually loaded while being pivoted broadly about a point on the FP. Using a computational method based on static equilibrium, it is possible to independently measure the rod's orientation and tip position during the moving trial, using FP derived data exclusively, and to compare these estimates to rod orientation and tip position estimates derived exclusively from the motion capture component. The motion laboratory accreditation test (MLAT) variables include: the difference (angle) between the orientation of the long axis of the testing device as independently determined from kinematic measures (motion capture component) and the FP derived data; and the difference (x, y, z) between the center of pressure position (FP derived) and the position of the testing device tip (motion capture derived) that loads the FP. A numerical dynamics model was explored to evaluate the appropriateness of the static equilibrium-based FP data model and to determine guidelines for testing device movement frequency and FP loading. The MLAT technique provides a simple means of detecting the combined presence of errors from many sources, several of which are explored in this paper. The MLAT has been developed to help meet one criteria of the CMA laboratory accreditation process, and to serve as a routine quality assessment tool.},

  abstract = {Motorized treadmills are commonly used in biomechanical and clinical studies of human walking. Whether treadmill walking induces identical motor responses to overground walking, however, is equivocal. The purpose of this study was to examine differences in the spatiotemporal gait parameters of the lower extremities and trunk during treadmill and overground walking using comparison of mean and variability values. Twenty healthy participants (age 23.8 {\AE} 1.2 years) walked for 6 min on a treadmill and overground while wearing APDM 6 Opal inertial monitors. Stride length, stride time, stride velocity, cadence, stance phase percentage, and peak sagittal and frontal plane trunk velocities were measured. Mean values were calculated for each parameter as well as estimates of short- (SD1) and long-term variability (SD2) using Poincare{\textasciiacute} analyses. The mean, SD1, and SD2 values were compared between overground and treadmill walking conditions with paired t-tests (a = 0.05) and with effect size estimates using Cohen's d statistic. Mean values for each of the gait parameters were statistically equivalent between treadmill and overground walking (p {$>$} 0.05). The SD1 and SD2 values representing short- and long-term variability were considerably reduced (p {$<$} 0.05) on the treadmill as compared to overground walking. This demonstrates the importance of consideration of gait variability when using treadmills for research or clinical purposes. Treadmill training may induce invariant gait patterns, posing difficulty in translating locomotor skills gained on a treadmill to overground walking conditions.},

More recent data suggest that stepping intensity and variability are also important, although such strategies are often discouraged early poststroke. Objective. The present study examined the efficacy of high-intensity, variable stepping training on walking and nonwalking outcomes in individuals 1 to 6 months poststroke as compared with conventional interventions. Methods. Individuals with unilateral stroke (mean duration = 101 days) were randomized to receive {$\leq$}40, 1-hour experimental or control training sessions over 10 weeks. Experimental interventions consisted only of stepping practice at high cardiovascular intensity (70\%-80\% heart rate reserve) in variable contexts (tasks or environments). Control interventions were determined by clinical physical therapists and supplemented using standardized conventional strategies. Blinded assessments were obtained at baseline, midtraining, and posttraining with a 2-month follow-up. Results. A total of 32 individuals (15 experimental) received different training paradigms that varied in the amount, intensity, and types of tasks performed. Primary outcomes of walking speed (experimental, 0.27 {\textpm} 0.22 m/s vs control, 0.09 {\textpm} 0.09 m/s) and distances (119 {\textpm} 113 m vs 30 {\textpm} 32 m) were different between groups, with stepping amount and intensity related to these differences. Gains in temporal gait symmetry and self-reported participation scores were greater following experimental training, without differences in balance or sit-to-stand performance. Conclusion. Variable intensive stepping training resulted in greater improvements in walking ability than conventional interventions early poststroke. Future studies should evaluate the relative contributions of these training parameters.},

For able-bodied individuals, trailing limb angle contributes twice as much as ankle moment to increases in propulsive force during speed modulation. The aim of this study was to quantify the relative contribution of ankle moment and trailing limb angle to increases in propulsive force for individuals poststroke. Methods: A biomechanical-based model previously developed for able-bodied individuals was evaluated and enhanced for individuals poststroke. Gait analysis was performed as subjects (N = 24) with chronic poststroke hemiparesis walked at their self-selected and fast walking speeds on a treadmill. Results: Both trailing limb angle and ankle moment increased during speed modulation. In the paretic limb, the contribution from trailing limb angle versus ankle moment to increases in propulsive force is 74\% and 17\%. In the non-paretic limb, the contribution from trailing limb angle versus ankle moment to increases in propulsive force is 67\% and 22\%. Conclusions: Individuals poststroke increase propulsive force mainly by changing trailing limb angle in both the paretic and non-paretic limbs. This strategy may contribute to the inefficiency in poststroke walking patterns. Future work is needed to examine whether these characteristics can be modified via intervention.},

Previous studies have demonstrated that propulsion, the force used to propel the body forward, determines walking speed. However, there are several different ways of measuring propulsion and no studies have identified which measurement best reflects differences in walking speed. The primary purposes of this study were to determine for individuals poststroke, which measurement of propulsion (1) is most closely related to their self-selected walking speeds and (2) best reflects changes in walking speed within a session. Participants (N{$\frac{1}{4}$} 43) with chronic poststroke hemiparesis walked at their self-selected and maximal walking speeds on a treadmill. Propulsive impulse, peak propulsive force, and mean propulsive value (propulsive impulse divided by duration) were analyzed. In addition, each participant's cadence was calculated. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to determine the relationships between different measurements of propulsion versus walking speed as well as changes in propulsion versus changes in walking speed. Stepwise linear regression was used to determine which measurement of propulsion best predicted walking speed and changes in walking speed. The results showed that all 3 measurements of propulsion were correlated to walking speed, with peak propulsive force showed the strongest correlation. Similarly, when participants increased their walking speeds, changes in peak propulsive forces showed the strongest correlation to changes in walking speed. In addition, multiplying each measurement by cadence improved the correlations. The present study suggests that measuring peak propulsive force and cadence may be most appropriate of the variables studied to characterize propulsion in individuals poststroke.},

However, little is known about the relative contribution of the paretic versus the nonparetic propulsive forces to changes in walking speed. Objective. The primary purpose of this study was to determine the contribution of propulsive force generated from each limb to changes in walking speed during speed modulation within a session and as a result of a 12-week training program. Methods. Gait analysis was performed as participants (N = 38) with chronic poststroke hemiparesis walked at their self-selected and faster walking speeds on a treadmill before and after a 12-week gait retraining program. Results. Prior to training, stroke survivors increased nonparetic propulsive forces as the primary mechanism to change walking speed during speed modulation within a session. Following gait training, the paretic limb played a larger role during speed modulation within a session. In addition, the increases in paretic propulsive forces observed following gait training contributed to the increases in the self-selected walking speeds seen following training. Conclusions. Gait retraining in the chronic phase of stroke recovery facilitates paretic limb neuromotor recovery and reduces the reliance on the nonparetic limb's generation of propulsive force to increase walking speed. These findings support gait rehabilitation efforts directed toward improving the paretic limb's ability to generate propulsive force.},

  abstract = {Restoring functional gait speed is an important goal for rehabilitation post-stroke. During walking, transferring of one's body weight between the limbs and maintaining balance stability are necessary for independent functional gait. Although it is documented that individuals post-stroke commonly have difficulties with performing weight transfer onto their paretic limbs, it remains to be determined if these deficits contributed to slower walking speeds. The primary purpose of this study was to compare the weight transfer characteristics between slow and fast post-stroke ambulators. Participants (N~=~36) with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis walked at their comfortable and maximal walking speeds on a treadmill. Participants were stratified into 2 groups based on their comfortable walking speeds ({$\geq$}0.8~m/s or {$<$}0.8~m/s). Minimum body center of mass (COM) to center of pressure (COP) distance, weight transfer timing, step width, lateral foot placement relative to the COM, hip moment, peak vertical and anterior ground reaction forces, and changes in walking speed were analyzed. Results showed that slow walkers walked with a delayed and deficient weight transfer to the paretic limb, lower hip abductor moment, and more lateral paretic limb foot placement relative to the COM compared to fast walkers. In addition, propulsive force and walking speed capacity was related to lateral weight transfer ability. These findings demonstrated that deficits in lateral weight transfer and stability could potentially be one of the limiting factors underlying comfortable walking speeds and a determinant of chronic stroke survivors' ability to increase walking speed.},

Seventeen older (71.5 {\textpm} 4.2 years) and eighteen young (27.0 {\textpm} 4.7 years) healthy adults walked over flat and uneven brick surfaces wearing an inertial measurement unit (IMU) over the L5 vertebra. IMU data were binned into smaller data segments using 4-s sliding windows with 1-s step lengths. Ninety percent of the data were used as training inputs and the remaining ten percent were saved for testing. A deep learning network with long short-term memory units was used for training (fully supervised), prediction, and implementation. Four models were trained using the following inputs: all nine channels from every sensor in the IMU (fully trained model), accelerometer signals alone, gyroscope signals alone, and magnetometer signals alone. The fully trained models for surface and age outperformed all other models (area under the receiver operator curve, AUC = 0.97 and 0.96, respectively; p {$\leq$}.045). The fully trained models for surface and age had high accuracy (96.3, 94.7\%), precision (96.4, 95.2\%), recall (96.3, 94.7\%), and f1-score (96.3, 94.6\%). These results demonstrate that processing the signals of a single IMU device with machine-learning algorithms enables the detection of surface conditions and age-group status from an individual's walking behavior which, with further learning, may be utilized to facilitate identifying and intervening on fall risk.},

However, the relative contributions of the variables primarily used to calculate the knee adduction moment have not been investigated. The objectives of this paper were to: (1) describe and compare the magnitude and temporal characteristics of the knee adduction moment, frontal plane lever arm, and frontal plane ground reaction force (GRF) during gait in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and, (2) examine the associations among these variables. Results indicated that both the knee adduction moment and the frontal plane GRF varied considerably throughout stance and exhibited the characteristic ``double-hump'' pattern, while the frontal plane lever arm magnitude varied only slightly during stance. Knees with OA had significantly greater peak knee adduction moments and frontal plane lever arms, but significantly less peak frontal plane GRF than knees without OA. Pearson product moment correlations indicated a higher association between peak knee adduction moment and peak frontal plane lever arm than between peak knee adduction moment and peak frontal plane GRF, particularly in knees with OA. These results suggest that the frontal plane lever arm assessed during walking is an important variable in the examination of knee OA, and warrants further investigation.},

  abstract = {Background: Wearable sensor systems can provide data for at-home gait analyses and input to controllers for rehabilitation devices but they often have reduced estimation accuracy compared to laboratory systems. The goal of this study is to evaluate a portable, low-cost system for measuring ground reaction forces and ankle joint torques in treadmill walking and calf raises. Methods: To estimate the ground reaction forces and ankle joint torques, we developed a custom instrumented insole and a tissue force sensor. Six healthy subjects completed a collection of movements (calf raises, 1.0 m/s walking, and 1.5 m/s walking) on two separate days. We trained artificial neural networks on the study data and compared the estimates to a multi-camera motion system and an instrumented treadmill. We evaluated the relative strength of each sensor by testing each sensor's ability to predict the ankle joint torque calculated from a reference inverse kinematics algorithm. We assessed model accuracy through root mean squared error and normalized root mean square error. We hypothesized that the estimation of the models would have normalized root mean square error measures less than 10 \%. Results: For walking at 1.0 and walking at 1.5 m/s, the single-task, intra-day and multi-task, intra-day predictions had normalized root mean square error less than 10 \% for all three force components and both center of pressure components. For the calf raise task, the single-task, intra-day and multi-task, intra-day predictions had normalized root mean square error less than 10 \% for only the anterior-posterior center of pressure. The multi-task, intra-day model had similar predictions to the single-task, intra-day model. The normalized root mean square error of predictions from the insole sensor alone were less than 10 \% for walking at 1.0 m/s and 1.5 m/s. No sensor was sufficient for the calf raise task. The combination of the insole sensor and the tendon sensor had lower normalized root mean square error than the individual sensors for all three tasks. Conclusions: The proposed sensor system provided accurate estimates for five of the six components of the ground reaction kinetics during walking at 1.0 and 1.5 m/s and one of the six components during the calf raise task. The normalized root mean square error of the predictions of the ground reaction forces were similar to published studies using commercial devices. The proposed system of low-cost sensors can provide useful estimations of ankle joint torque for both walking and calf raises for future studies in mobile gait analysis.},

The adoption of technology into sport is no exception where advances in materials, equipment design and clothing have had a profound influence on sport. More recently the widespread use of sensors has had an impact on equipment design, together with the practice and performance of sport. The use of sensors is attractive; they offer the possibility to provide new information in a laboratory context, which was difficult to obtain previously, such as in the ambulatory or `in field' environment to build a better sporting equipment or a better athlete. The list of application is long and growing rapidly, particularly in the adoption of inertial sensors, force transduction and wearable technologies. Today, micro-sensors have been adopted by mainstream companies as consumer and specialist sport technologies for diverse markets such as gaming, telecommu- nications and sports. The range of sports where micro-sensors have been used is growing; sensors have been used for purposes such as the improvement of equipment design, the evolution of sport and the monitoring of performance of athletes. Sensor technologies have been implemented in a wide range of sports to provide a broad range of information including load from strain gauges in the design and validation of better skis, motion from inertial sensors in half-pipe snowboarding to detect air time and activity, rower biomechanics and boat movement through the water, force-plate simulations, contact time, step rate and other biomechanical information in running, as well as estimates of energy expenditure. This paper reviews the adoption of sensors in sport, together with guidelines for the implementation and the identification of likely future trends including wearable technology.},

The detection of end contact (EC), normally toe-off, and initial contact (IC) normally, heel strike was based on either foot linear accelerations or foot sagittal angular velocity or shank sagittal angular velocity. The results showed that all three methods were as accurate as foot switches in estimating times of IC and EC for normal gait patterns. In spinal-cord injured subjects, shank angular velocity was significantly less accurate ( p {$<$} 0.02).

However, activity levels in this population are low, in part due to concern that activity will damage the knee joint. We hypothesized that sedentary and moderate-\-vigorous physical activity are each associated with greater risk of radiographic worsening of knee OA. Methods. In Osteoarthritis Initiative participants with or at higher risk for knee OA enrolled in an accelerometer substudy at 48 months (study baseline), physical activity was measured by a uniaxial accelerometer (ActiGraph GT1M). Radiographic progression was defined as any 48 month to 96 month worsening of Kellgren/Lawrence (K/L) grade scores. All analyses were knee-l\-evel; we used multivariable logistic regression with generalized estimating equations, adjusting for key covariates. Results. Of the 1,206 participants, 631 (52\%) were female, the mean {\textpm} SD age was 64 {\textpm} 9 years, and mean {\textpm} SD body mass index (BMI) was 28 {\textpm} 5. The mean {\textpm} SD average daily sedentary activity was 602 {\textpm} 86 minutes, average daily light activity was 284 {\textpm} 75 minutes, and average daily moderate-v\- igorous activity was 20 {\textpm} 20 minutes. In 1,978 knees, 267 (14\%) had worsening of K/L grade scores. In the multivariable model, age, sex, BMI, and pain, were associated with K/L grade worsening, but neither sedentary activity (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.99 [95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 0.97--1.01]) nor moderate-v\- igorous activity (adjusted OR 1.00 [95\% CI 0.91--1.09]) were associated with K/L grade worsening. Conclusion. In persons with or at higher risk for knee OA, age, sex, BMI, and pain, but not objectively meas\- ured average daily minutes of sedentary or moderate-v\- igorous activity, were associated with subsequent worsening of K/L grade. Whether findings differ in persons with more severe knee OA and/or engaged more frequently in moderate-\- vigorous activity should be examined in future studies.},

This study evaluates the SIS in the UK context, and develops a single index and an 8-item short form.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: Patients with a diagnosis of stroke were recruited through general practices in London and the North-West of England. Patients completed the SIS and the EQ-5D.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Internal consistency of the SIS dimensions and the disability score ranged from {$\alpha$} 0.86 to 0.95. Complete data were available on 73 questionnaires (48.34\%). Factor analysis suggested the 8 domains could be aggregated into a single index. A short-form SIS (SF-SIS) index was created by summing 1 item per dimension. Selected items were those that most highly correlated with their respective domain score ({$\rho$} ranged from 0.77-0.94, P{$<$}0.001). The SF-SIS index scores were highly correlated with those gained from the parent form ({$\rho$}=0.98; P{$<$}0.001). The correlation of the SIS index and SF-SIS index with the EQ-5D was identical ({$\rho$}=0.83; P{$<$}0.001).

The amount of incomplete data suggests that the length of the questionnaire may present a substantial patient burden.

To test this hypothesis, we measured gait kinematics and kinetics of 12 persons with hemiparesis following stroke at self-selected and fast walking conditions. Two groups were identified: (1) lower functioning subjects (n = 6) who increased normalized walking speed from 0.52 leg lengths/s (ll/s, SEM: 0.04) to 0.72 ll/s (SEM: 0.03) and (2) higher functioning subjects (n = 6) who increased walking speed from 0.88 ll/s (SEM: 0.04) to 1.4 ll/s (SEM 0.03). Changes in spatiotemporal parameters, joint kinematics and kinetics between self-selected and fast walking were compared to control subjects examined at matched walking speeds (0.35 ll/s (SEM: 0.03), 0.63 ll/s (SEM: 0.03), 0.92 ll/s (SEM: 0.04) and 1.4 ll/s (SEM: 0.04)). Similar to speed-matched controls, the higher functioning hemiparetic subjects increased paretic limb hip flexion power and ankle plantarflexion power to increase walking speed. The lower functioning hemiparetic subjects did not increase power generation at the hip or ankle to increase walking speed. This observation suggests that impaired ankle power generation combined with saturation of hip power generation limits the potential to increase walking speed in lower functioning hemiparetic subjects.},

  abstract = {Background. Electromyographic biofeedback (EMG-BFB) has shown equivocal benefits on gait retraining after stroke. Objective.The authors evaluated the efficacy of EMG-BFB applied in a task-oriented approach based on principles of motor learning to increase peak ankle power of the affected leg and gait velocity in patients with chronic mild to moderate hemiparesis. Methods. They assigned 20 participants randomly to the EMG-BFB group or a control group that received conventional therapy for the same duration. Quantitative gait analysis was performed before and after treatment. The EMG-BFB involved the triceps surae during functional gait activities. Treatment was administered with a fading frequency of BFB application and an increasing variability in gait activities. Both groups had 20 treatment sessions of 45 minutes each, including at least 15 minutes of walking-related therapy for the control group. Follow-up (FU) gait analysis was obtained 6 weeks after training. Results. BFB treatment led to significant increases (P {$<$} .01) in peak ankle power at push-off (from 0.63 W/kg to 1.04 W/kg) in conjunction with significant increases in velocity (from 28.3 \%h/s---normalized to percentage height per second---to 39.6 \%h/s) and stride length (from 44.5 \%h---normalized to percentage height---to 57.6 \%h). Increases remained significant at FU.There were no changes in any gait variable in the control group. Conclusion.A task-oriented BFB treatment was effective in increasing peak ankle power, gait velocity, and stride length in a population with hemiparesis. Further studies should compare the combination intervention with either of its components in more impaired patients.},

Kinematic data from treadmill walking trials lasting 20--45 s were collected from three subject populations (healthy young, n = 7; multiple sclerosis, n = 7; stroke, n = 4). Overground walking trials consisted of approximately eight successful passes over two force plates for a healthy subject population (n = 5). Time of heel strike and toe-off were determined using the two new computational techniques and compared to events detected using vertical ground reaction force (GRF) as a gold standard. The two algorithms determined 94\% of the treadmill events from healthy subjects within one frame (0.0167 s) of the GRF events. In the impaired populations, 89\% of treadmill events were within two frames (0.0334 s) of the GRF events. For overground trials, 98\% of events were within two frames. Automatic event detection from the two kinematic-based algorithms will aid researchers by accurately determining gait events during the analysis of treadmill and overground walking.},

  abstract = {Gait variability has been correlated with fall risk in the elderly. Older adults typically display greater variability than young adults, but the cause of this increase is unclear. Slower walking leads to greater variability in young adults, but slow speeds are also typical in older adults. Increased variability in older adults may result from slower walking speeds, or possibly from other factors related to aging. We tested whether greater variability in healthy older adults could be attributed directly to slower walking speed. Eighteen healthy older adults (age 72 {\AE} 6) and 17 gender-, height- and weight-matched young adults (age 23 {\AE} 3) walked on a treadmill at speeds of 80--120\% of their preferred speed. Variability of spatio-temporal gait measures, lower extremity joint angles, and trunk motions were quantified, along with bilateral isometric leg strengths and passive joint ranges of motion. Preferred walking speeds were not different between our healthy elderly and young subjects. In both groups, variability was speed-dependent for stride time, frontal hip and knee motions, knee internal/external rotations, and all trunk motions ( p {$<$} 0.002). Older adults exhibited greater variability ( p = 0.0003) for trunk roll, independent of changes in speed. Step length ( p = 0.005), stride time ( p = 0.018), and trunk pitch ( p = 0.022) exhibited similar trends. This greater variability was explained by decreased leg strength and passive ranges of motion. Thus, the greater variability observed in the gait of older adults may result more from loss of strength and flexibility than from their slower speeds.},

  abstract = {Falls pose a tremendous risk to those over 65 and most falls occur during locomotion. Older adults commonly walk slower, which many believe helps improve walking stability. While increased gait variability predicts future fall risk, increased variability is also caused by walking slower. Thus, we need to better understand how differences in age and walking speed independently affect dynamic stability during walking. We investigated if older adults improved their dynamic stability by walking slower, and how leg strength and flexibility (passive range of motion (ROM)) affected this relationship. Eighteen active healthy older and 17 healthy younger adults walked on a treadmill for 5 min each at each of 5 speeds (80--120\% of preferred). Local divergence exponents and maximum Floquet multipliers (FM) were calculated to quantify each subject's inherent local dynamic stability. The older subjects walked with the same preferred walking speeds as the younger subjects (p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.860). However, these older adults still exhibited greater local divergence exponents (po0.0001) and higher maximum FM (po0.007) than the younger adults at all walking speeds. These older adults remained more locally unstable (po0.04) even after adjusting for declines in both strength and ROM. In both age groups, local divergence exponents decreased at slower speeds and increased at faster speeds (po0.0001). Maximum FM showed similar changes with speed (po0.02). Both younger and older adults exhibited decreased instability by walking slower, in spite of increased variability. These increases in dynamic instability might be more sensitive indicators of future fall risk than changes in gait variability.},

Their assessment is conventionally achieved using laboratory-based equipment that cannot be applied in daily life monitoring. In this study, we propose a method to predict GRF\&amp;M during walking, using exclusively kinematic information from fully-ambulatory inertial motion capture (IMC). From the equations of motion, we derive the total external forces and moments. Then, we solve the indeterminacy problem during double stance using a distribution algorithm based on a smooth transition assumption. The agreement between the IMC-predicted and reference GRF\&amp;M was categorized over normal walking speed as excellent for the vertical ({$\rho$} = 0.992, rRMSE = 5.3\%), anterior ({$\rho$} = 0.965, rRMSE = 9.4\%) and sagittal ({$\rho$} = 0.933, rRMSE = 12.4\%) GRF\&amp;M components and as strong for the lateral ({$\rho$} = 0.862, rRMSE = 13.1\%), frontal ({$\rho$} = 0.710, rRMSE = 29.6\%), and transverse GRF\&amp;M ({$\rho$} = 0.826, rRMSE = 18.2\%). Sensitivity analysis was performed on the effect of the cut-off frequency used in the filtering of the input kinematics, as well as the threshold velocities for the gait event detection algorithm. This study was the first to use only inertial motion capture to estimate 3D GRF\&amp;M during gait, providing comparable accuracy with optical motion capture prediction. This approach enables applications that require estimation of the kinetics during walking outside the gait laboratory.},

Despite the demonstrated benefits of these conservative treatments, their clinical adoption is currently obstructed by the high complexity, spatial demands, and cost of optical motion capture systems. In this study we propose and evaluate a wearable visual feedback system for gait retraining of the foot progression angle (FPA). Methods: The primary components of the system are inertial measurement units, which track the human movement without spatial limitations, and an augmented reality headset used to project the visual feedback in the visual field. The adapted gait protocol contained five different target angles ranging from 15 degrees toe-out to 5 degrees toe-in. Eleven healthy participants walked on an instrumented treadmill, and the protocol was performed using both an established laboratory visual feedback driven by optical motion capture, and the proposed wearable system. Results and conclusions: The wearable system tracked FPA with an accuracy of 2.4 degrees RMS and ICC=0.94 across all target angles and subjects, when compared to an optical motion capture reference. In addition, the effectiveness of the biofeedback, reflected by the number of steps with FPA value {\textpm}2 degrees from the target, was found to be around 50\% in both wearable and laboratory approaches. These findings demonstrate that retraining of the FPA using wearable inertial sensing and visual feedback is feasible with effectiveness matching closely an established laboratory method. The proposed wearable setup may reduce the complexity of gait retraining applications and facilitate their transfer to routine clinical practice.},

To address this problem, we propose the use of inertial motion capture to perform musculoskeletal model-based inverse dynamics by utilizing a universally applicable ground reaction force and moment (GRF\&M) prediction method. Validation against a conventional laboratory-based method showed excellent Pearson correlations for sagittal plane joint angles of ankle, knee, and hip ({$\rho$} = 0.95, 0.99, and 0.99, respectively) and root-mean-squared-differences (RMSD) of 4.1 {\textpm} 1.3{$^\circ$}, 4.4 {\textpm} 2.0{$^\circ$}, and 5.7 {\textpm} 2.1{$^\circ$}, respectively.

Force-sensing split-belt treadmills (TMs) provide an alternative to the conventional overground (OG) setting and allow new avenues for analyzing the biomechanics and motor control of walking. However, walking control may differ on a TM compared with walking OG. Objective. To compare spatiotemporal, kinematic, and EMG-based measures of motor control between TM and OG walking at self-selected and fastest comfortable speeds in persons with poststroke hemiparesis. Methods. Individuals with chronic hemiparesis (56) and similarly aged healthy individuals (17) walked over an instrumented walkway and on an instrumented split-belt TM; 16 channels of EMG recorded bilateral muscle activity, and a 12-camera motion capture system collected bilateral 3D kinematics. The authors applied a nonnegative matrix factorization (NNMF) algorithm to examine the underlying patterns of motor control. Results. Self-selected walking patterns differed on the TM versus OG in controls: speed decreased, stride length decreased, stance percentage increased, and double-support percentage increased. Poststroke, responses were similar, but cadence also decreased, and step length asymmetry increased. Kinematic patterns were similar except those associated with slower walking speeds. NNMF demonstrated similar EMG variance in the 2 environments. Conclusion. Persons, both healthy and poststroke, walk with different gait parameters on the TM. Although measures of motor control were mostly similar between the 2 environments, the TM induced step length asymmetry in 30\% of participants (60\% of whom took longer paretic steps). TM walking, therefore, is a valid method for detecting motor control deficits.},

The benefits of using accelerometers compared to more traditional gait analysis instruments include low cost; testing is not restricted to a laboratory environment; accelerometers are small, therefore walking is relatively unrestricted; and direct measurement of 3D accelerations eliminate errors associated with differentiating displacement and velocity data. However, accelerometry is not without its disadvantages, an issue which is scarcely reported in gait analysis literature. This paper reviews the use of accelerometer technology to investigate gait-related movement patterns, and addresses issues of acceleration measurement important for experimental design. An overview of accelerometer mechanics is provided before illustrating specific experimental conditions necessary to ensure the accuracy of gaitrelated acceleration measurement. A literature review is presented on how accelerometry has been used to examine basic temporospatial gait parameters, shock attenuation, and segmental accelerations of the body during walking. The output of accelerometers attached to the upper body has provided useful insights into the motor control of normal walking, age-related differences in dynamic postural control, and gait patterns in people with movement disorders.},

Its functionality derives from striking a balance between independence versus interdependence among component activities, e.g., fin or leg oscillations in lipfish and centipede models, respectively. A similar balancing act in the Ising (1925) model was found to produce patterns of electron spin alignment, analogous to the softassembly of locomotive patterns. The Ising model analog to relative coordination is metastability, and Kelso (1995) hypothesized that metastability is essential to sensorimotor functions across levels and domains of analysis, from individual neurons to neural systems to anatomical components of all kinds. In the present survey, relative coordination and metastability are hypothesized to underlie the soft-assembly of sensorimotor function, and this hypothesis is shown to predict 1/f scaling as a pervasive property of intrinsic fluctuations. Evidence is reviewed in support of this prediction from studies of human neural activity, as well as response time tasks and speech production tasks.},

  abstract = {Criticality in Neural Systems\vphantom\{\}, year = \{2014\}, abstract = \{Coordinative structures -- collectives of elements temporarily constrained to accomplish a goal, task, or function -- are proposed as the basis of neural and behavioral function. Coordinative structures are functional linkages, softly assembled, and context sensitive. They have multiple realizations and manifestations, from the cooperative behavior of molecules and cells to the pattern-generating capacities of multifunctional neural circuits within and between brains: they span all kinds of processes at every known level of biological and social organization. They are nature's way to handle degeneracy: combinations of different elements and the recruitment of new ones through alternate paths are used to accomplish the same functional outcome. Although shaped by evolution, development, and learning, experiments and theoretical modeling at both behavioral and neural levels have demonstrated that coordinative structures are self-organized: they exhibit all the predicted features of nonequilibrium phase transitions, a basic form of self-organization in nature. Self-organization refers to the spontaneous formation and change of patterns that occurs near criticality in nature's open systems. Switching and decision making are observed to occur in the brain and behavior, but there are no switches or decision makers. By living near criticality, the brain exploits variability and time-dependent parameter tuning to explore the range of potential options available -- its full dynamical repertoire -- and to select those that fit current circumstances. Although it has proved possible to derive or synthesize the relation within and between behavioral and neural levels of description, even in their simplest form the nonlinear dynamical laws (Coordination Dynamics) appear to be truly emergent and sui generis. They fall into the category of Laughlin and Pines's (2000) ``protectorates'' or ``higher order principles,'' Anderson's (1972) ``more is different,'' and Schr{\"o}dinger's (1944) ``new laws to be expected in the organism'' (Kelso and Haken, 1995; Murphy and O'Neill, 1995). As Einstein was reported to say, you only need to look at living things to see how primitive physics is. Still.\vphantom\}},

  abstract = {Objectives: It is not known whether changes in the biomechanics of elderly gait are related to aging per se, or to reduced walking speed in this population. The goals of the present study were to identify specific biomechanical changes, independent of speed, that might impair gait performance in healthy older people by identifying age-associated changes in the biomechanics of gait, and to determine which of these changes persist at increased walking speed. Design: Stereophotogrammetric and force platform data were collected, Differences in peak joint motion (kinematic) and joint moment and power (kinetic) values between healthy young and elderly subjects at comfortable and increased walking speed were measured. Setting: A gait laboratory. Subjects: Thirty-one healthy elderly (age 65 to 84 years) and 31 healthy young adult subjects (age 18 to 36 years), all without known neurologic, musculoskeletal, cardiac, or pulmonary problems. Main Outcome Measures: All major peak kinematic and kinetic variables during the gait cycle. Results: Several kinematic and kinetic differences between young and elderly adults were found that did not persist when walking speed was increased. Differences that persisted at both comfortable and fast walking speeds were reduced peak hip extension, increased anterior pelvic tilt, and reduced ankle plantarflexion and ankle power generation. Conclusion: Gait performance in the elderly may be limited by both subtle hip flexion contracture and ankle plantarflexor concentric weakness. Results of the current study should motivate future experimental trials of specific hip flexor stretching and ankle plantarflexor concentric strengthening exercises to preserve and potentially improve walking performance in the elderly.},

The actual reduction in vertical displacement was also calculated. Setting: A gait laboratory. Participants: Thirty able-bodied subjects. Main Outcome Measure: The estimated reduction in COM vertical displacement caused by pelvic rotation was compared with the actual reduction in COM displacement. Results: The estimated effect of pelvic rotation in reducing COM displacement was 2.5 Ϯ 1.1mm, accounting for only 12\% of the actual reduction. Conclusion: During normal comfortable speed walking by able-bodied subjects, pelvic rotation contributes only a small portion of the actual reduction in the vertical displacement of the COM compared with a compass gait model. Other primary gait factors or determinants are needed to explain the actual reduction in vertical displacement of the COM.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose---Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is a popular poststroke gait rehabilitation intervention. Although stroke causes multijoint gait deficits, FES is commonly used only for the correction of swing-phase foot drop. Ankle plantarflexor muscles play an important role during gait. The aim of the current study was to test the immediate effects of delivering FES to both ankle plantarflexors and dorsiflexors on poststroke gait. Methods---Gait analysis was performed as subjects (Nϭ13) with chronic poststroke hemiparesis walked at their self-selected walking speeds during walking with and without FES. Results---Compared with delivering FES to only the ankle dorsiflexor muscles during the swing phase, delivering FES to both the paretic ankle plantarflexors during terminal stance and dorsiflexors during the swing phase provided the advantage of greater swing-phase knee flexion, greater ankle plantarflexion angle at toe-off, and greater forward propulsion. Although FES of both the dorsiflexor and plantarflexor muscles improved swing-phase ankle dorsiflexion compared with noFES, the improvement was less than that observed by stimulating the dorsiflexors alone, suggesting the need to further optimize stimulation parameters and timing for the dorsiflexor muscles during gait. Conclusions---In contrast to the typical FES approach of stimulating ankle dorsiflexor muscles only during the swing phase, delivering FES to both the plantarflexor and dorsiflexor muscles can help to correct poststroke gait deficits at multiple joints (ankle and knee) during both the swing and stance phases of gait. Our study shows the feasibility and advantages of stimulating the ankle plantarflexors during FES for poststroke gait. (Stroke. 2009;40:3821-3827.)},

  abstract = {Post-stroke gait impairments are common and result in slowed walking speeds and decreased community participation post-stroke. Treadmill training has recently emerged as an effective gait rehabilitation intervention. Furthermore, kinematic and kinetic data collected during treadmill walking are commonly used for assessing gait performance. The minimal detectable change (MDC) for gait variables provides a useful index to determine whether the magnitude of change in gait produced after an intervention is greater than the amount of change attributable to day-to-day variability in gait or test--retest measurement errors. The MDC values for kinematic, ground reaction force (GRF), spatial, and temporal variables collected during treadmill walking post-stroke have not been previously reported. The objective of this study was, therefore, to compute MDCs for post-stroke gait kinematics, GRF indices, temporal, and spatial measures during treadmill walking. Nineteen individuals with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis (12 males; age = 47--75 years; 72.6 {\AE} 63.4 months since stroke) participated in 2 testing sessions separated by 20.7 {\AE} 26.8 days. Our results showed that test--retest reliability was excellent for all gait variables tested (intraclass correlation coefficients = 0.799--0.986). MDCs were reported for hip, knee, and ankle joint angles (range 3.88 for trailing limb angles to 11.58 for hip extension), peak anterior GRF (2.85\% body weight), mean vertical GRF (4.65\% body weight), all temporal variables (range 3.2--4.2\% gait cycle), and paretic step length (6.7 cm). These MDCs provide a useful reference to help interpret the magnitudes of changes in post-stroke gait variables.},

Despite higher muscle co-contraction, medial compartment contact force was lower for the involved limb, compared to both the uninvolved limb (mean difference {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.39 body weight, p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.009, effect size {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.70) as well as the control limb (mean difference {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.57 body weight, p {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.007, effect size {$\frac{1}{4}$} 1.14).

Surgical reconstruction is the current standard of care for treatment of ACL injuries in active patients. The widespread adoption of ACL reconstruction over primary repair was based on early perception of the limited healing capacity of the ACL. Although the majority of ACL reconstruction surgeries successfully restore gross joint stability, post-traumatic osteoarthritis is commonplace following these injuries, even with ACL reconstruction. The development of new techniques to limit the long-term clinical sequelae associated with ACL reconstruction has been the main focus of research over the past decades. The improved knowledge of healing, along with recent advances in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, has resulted in the discovery of novel biologically augmented ACL-repair techniques that have satisfactory outcomes in preclinical studies. This instructional review provides a summary of the latest advances made in ACL repair. Cite this article: Bone Joint Res 2014;3:20-31.},

  abstract = {Running-related injuries (RRI) may result from accumulated microtrauma caused by combinations of high load magnitudes (vertical ground reaction forces; vGRFs) and numbers (strides). Yet relationships between vGRF and RRI remain unclear -- potentially because previous research has largely been constrained to collecting vGRFs in laboratory settings and ignoring relationships between RRI and stride number. In this preliminary proof-of-concept study, we addressed these constraints: Over a 60-day period, each time collegiate athletes (n = 9) ran they wore a hip-mounted activity monitor that collected accelerations throughout the entire run. Accelerations were used to estimate peak vGRF, number of strides, and weighted cumulative loading (sum of peak vGRFs weighted to the 9th power) across the entirety of each run. Runners also reported their post-training pain/fatigue and any RRI that prevented training. Across 419 runs and {$>$}2.1 million strides, injured (n = 3) and uninjured (n = 6) participants did not report significantly different pain/fatigue (p = 0.56) or mean number of strides per run (p = 0.91). Injured participants did, however, have significantly greater peak vGRFs (p = 0.01) and weighted cumulative loading per run (p {$<$} 0.01). Results from this small but extensively studied sample of elite runners demonstrate that loading profiles (load magnitude-number combinations) quantified with activity monitors can provide valuable information that may prove essential for: (1) testing hypotheses regarding overuse injury mechanisms, (2) developing injury-prediction models, and (3) designing and adjusting athlete- and loading-specific training programs and feedback.},

An experimental study was conducted to collect sufficient samples for training, validation and testing. The estimated results were compared with VGRF measured using an instrumented treadmill. The estimates yielded an average root mean square error of less than 0.017 of the body weight (BW) and a cross-correlation coefficient greater than 0.99. The results also demonstrated that NN could estimate impact force and active force with average errors ranging between 0.10 and 0.18 of BW at different running speeds. Using NN and uniaxial accelerometer can (1) simplify the estimation of VGRF, (2) reduce the computational requirement and (3) reduce the necessity of multiple wearable sensors to obtain relevant parameters.},

More than one type of kinematic and kinetic pattern was identified in all three planes in 20 individuals with stroke (age: 61.2{\textpm}8.4 years). Persons in the ``fast'' speed group did not necessarily exhibit the gait patterns closest to the ones reported for healthy adults. For example, in the frontal plane, a variation from the typical pattern (i.e., a hip abductor pattern in swing) was more common among the ``fast'' group. Correlations revealed that in addition to the sagittal profiles, the magnitudes of the frontal and transverse profiles are also related to speed, particularly the frontal hip powers. The results support the importance of hip abductors, in addition to the sagittal plane muscle groups, for both the paretic and non-paretic limbs. Furthermore, profiles which resemble gait patterns of neurologically healthy adults do not necessarily result in the faster gait speeds for individuals with chronic stroke.},

We investigated the activity, the injury mechanism, and the dynamic knee alignment at the time of the injury in 1,718 patients diagnosed as having the ACL injuries. Regarding the activity at the time of the injury, "competition "was the most common, accounting for about half of all the injuries. The current result also showed that the noncontact injury was the most common, which was observed especially in many female athletes. Finally, the dynamic alignment of "Knee-in \& Toe- out "(i.e. dynamic knee valgus) was the most common, accounting for about half. These results enhance our understanding of the ACL injury mechanism and may be used to guide future injury prevention strategies.

  abstract = {Background: The gait of a healthy person is believed to be more regular and symmetrical than those of an individual with a disease. Thus, symmetry and regularity are important indicators of human gait. Methods: The effects of age and gender on gait symmetry and regularity were investigated in 87 Japanese participants by measuring trunk accelerometry during a 7-m walk. The younger group included 26 female and 21 male students, and the elderly group included 24 females and 16 males. Average age for each group was 20 and 70 years, respectively. Gait symmetry and regularity were evaluated on the basis of autocorrelation functions of trunk accelerations of vertical and anteroposterior axes. Results: The relationship between age and gait symmetry and regularity was statistically significant for both vertical and anteroposterior axes. Elderly participants showed lower symmetry and regularity in their gait than young participants. A significant gender effect was observed for the symmetry index of both axes but not for the regularity index. Male participants showed lower gait symmetry than females. An interaction effect between age and gender was significant in the symmetry index of anteroposterior acceleration. Gender effect was appeared more clearly in elderly than young participants. Conclusion: Elderly participants showed a more asymmetrical and irregular gait than young participants. In addition to age, a significant gender effect was observed on gait symmetry. However, the effect size of gender was smaller than that of age, and it was not significant for gait regularity. The gait indices obtained by autocorrelation of trunk acceleration can be considered useful to evaluate aging effect on gait.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Wearable sensors can provide detailed information on human movement but the clinical impact of this information remains limited. We propose a machine learning approach, using wearable sensor data, to identify subject-specific changes in gait patterns related to improvements in clinical outcomes. Eight patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) completed two gait trials before and one following an exercise intervention. Wearable sensor data (e.g., 3-dimensional (3D) linear accelerations) were collected from a sensor located near the lower back, lateral thigh and lateral shank during level treadmill walking at a preferred speed. Wearable sensor data from the 2 pre-intervention gait trials were used to define each individual's typical movement pattern using a one-class support vector machine (OCSVM). The percentage of strides defined as outliers, based on the pre-intervention gait data and the OCSVM, were used to define the overall change in an individual's movement pattern. The correlation between the change in movement patterns following the intervention (i.e., percentage of outliers) and improvement in self-reported clinical outcomes (e.g., pain and function) was assessed using a Spearman rank correlation. The number of outliers observed post-intervention exhibited a large association ({$\rho$} = 0.78) with improvements in self-reported clinical outcomes. These findings demonstrate a proof-of-concept and a novel methodological approach for integrating machine learning and wearable sensor data. This approach provides an objective and evidence-informed way to understand clinically important changes in human movement patterns in response to exercise therapy.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {This work presents a multiplicative extended Kalman filter for estimating the relative state of a multirotor vehicle operating in a GPS-denied environment. The filter fuses data from an inertial measurement unit and altimeter with relative-pose updates from a keyframe-based visual odometry or laser scan-matching algorithm. Because the global position and heading states of the vehicle are unobservable in the absence of global measurements such as GPS, the filter in this paper estimates the state with respect to a local frame that is colocated with the odometry keyframe. As a result, the odometry update provides nearly-direct measurements of the relative vehicle pose, making those states observable. The derivation in this paper is intended to provide a complete, self-contained presentation that is tutorial in nature and that clearly defines all quaternion conventions and properties used. This paper also contains several improvements and extensions to the filter, and includes several new useful properties relating to error quaternions and their Euler-angle decomposition. Finally, this paper derives the filter both for traditional dynamics defined with respect to an inertial frame, and for robocentric dynamics defined with respect to the vehicle's body frame, and provides insights into the subtle differences that arise between the two formulations.},

  abstract = {The contribution of DNA damage to the effects of 193-nm excimer laser radiation on mammalian cells in culture was studied in order to evaluate the mutagenic potential of this IV wavelength in vivo. Two approaches were taken: measurement of pyrimidine dimer-specific endonuclease-sensitive sites/megabase and comparison of the 193-nm ra diation-induced cytotoxicity in normal versus DNA repair-deficient cells. The formation of pyrimidine dimer-specific endonuclease-sensitive sites/ megabase was inversely related to the thickness of the cytoplasm over lying the nuclei of normal human fibroblasts (NHF) and Chinese hamster ovary cells. The results of these measurements and a calculation of the absorption coefficient of cytoplasm indicate that each 1 Mmof cytoplasm attenuates the incident radiation by {$>$}90\% and, therefore, the nuclear DNA in tissue will be highly protected from 193-nm radiation by over lying cytoplasm. The reduction in colony-forming ability induced by 254-nm, 193-nm, and {\textbackslash}-ray radiation was measured in NHF, xeroderma pigmentosum (group A) cells, and ataxia telangiectasia cells. Xeroderma pigmentosum (group A) cells were 16.5 times more sensitive to 254-nm radiation but only 3.5 times more sensitive to 193-nm radiation than NHF cells, indicating that cyclobutylpyrimidine dimers were not the major lethal lesion formed at 193 nm. AT cells were 3.4 times more sensitive to Xrays than NHF cells, but these cell types were almost equally sensitive to 193-nm radiation, indicating that 193 nm did not induce the same type of lethal lesions as X-rays.},

Fourteen participants performed a breaststroke-swimming task that required them to develop a specific biomechanically expert pattern and in turn provide the basis for a suitable task vehicle to study the functional role of movement variability. Inter-limb coordination was defined based on the computation of continuous relative phase between elbow and knee oscillators. Unsupervised cluster analysis on arm-leg coordination revealed the existence of different patterns of coordination when participants achieved the same task goal under different levels of environmental constraints (i.e. different amounts of forward resistances). In addition, clusters differed in terms of higher order derivatives (e.g., joint angular velocity, joint amplitude), suggesting an effective role for degeneracy in learning by allowing the exploration of the key relationships between motor organization and interacting constraints. There is evidence to suggest that neurobiological degeneracy supports the potential for motor re-organization to enhance motor learning.},

Competitive interaction between cues was observed in a contingency judgement task.

After evaluating the heel switch timing against a reference system, namely the Vicon 370 marker and force plates system. Initial results show a close correlation between the current trigger detection and the inertial sensor based triggering algorithms. Algorithms were tested for stairs up and stairs down. Best results are observed for algorithms using gyroscope data. Algorithms were designed using threshold techniques for lowest possible computational load and with least possible sensor components to minimize power requirements and to allow for potential future implantation of sensor system.},

Two independent raters scored the methodological quality of the included articles. Walking speed and physiological cost index (PCI) were selected as the primary outcome measures. Studies that measured walking speed were pooled and a pooled difference including confidence interval was calculated. RESULTS: Eight studies were included in the review, of which one was a randomized controlled trial. Methodological score ranged from 8 to 18 out of 19. Six studies measured walking speed. The pooled improvement in walking speed was 0.13 m/s (0.07-0.2) or 38\% (22.18-53.8).

HYPOTHESIS: There is no difference in initial fixation strength between different hamstring tendon graft femoral fixation devices. STUDY DESIGN: Randomized experimental study. METHODS: Each of six devices was used in the fixation of 10 quadrupled human semitendinosus-gracilis tendon grafts in tunnels drilled in porcine femora and tested 10 times with a single-cycle load-to-failure test at a rate of 50 mm/min and 10 times with a 1500-cycle loading test between 50 and 200 N at one cycle every 2 seconds. The specimens that survived the cyclic loading were subjected to a single-cycle load-to-failure test. RESULTS: The Bone Mulch Screw (1112 N) was strongest in the single-cycle load-to-failure test, followed by EndoButton CL (1086 N), RigidFix (868 N), SmartScrew ACL (794 N), BioScrew (589 N), and RCI screw (546 N). It also showed the lowest residual displacement (2.2 mm) and was strongest in the single-cycle load-to-failure test after cyclic loading. CONCLUSIONS: The Bone Mulch Screw was superior to all other devices. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Caution may be warranted in employing aggressive rehabilitation after reconstruction with these devices.

Using data from the 2005 National Health Interview Survey (n = 31,482), this paper reports on the prevalence of transportation walking and leisure walking for U.S. adults and examines the variation in prevalence across different socio-demographic groups. The prevalence of transportation walking and leisure walking for U.S. adults ({$\geq$}5 days/week for {$\geq$} 30 min/day) was calculated using data from the 2005 National Health Interview Survey. Results. In the United States, 41.5\% of adults walked for leisure and 28.2\% walked for transportation in intervals of at least 10 min. The highest prevalence of transportation walking was among black non-Hispanic men (36.0\%) and Asian/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander women (40.5\%). The highest prevalence of leisure walking was among Asian/Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander men (42.0\%) and white non-Hispanic women (46.6\%). Leisure walking was most prevalent among respondents with higher incomes and education levels, whereas transportation walking increased in prevalence with education level but decreased with income level. Based on the findings, 6\% of U.S. adults were considered regularly active ({$\geq$} 5 days/week for {$\geq$} 30 min/day) by walking for transportation and 9\% were regularly active by walking for leisure. Conclusion. Leisure and transportation walking have distinctly different demographic correlates. These differences should guide interventions aimed at influencing walking for different purposes.

A large number of clinical trials continue to assess aspects of this rehabilitation process. Prior systematic reviews evaluated fifty-four Level-I and II clinical trials published through 2005. METHODS: Eighty-five articles from 2006 to 2010 were identified utilizing multiple search engines. Twenty-nine Level-I or II studies met inclusion criteria and were evaluated with use of the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) criteria. Topics included in this review are postoperative bracing, accelerated strengthening, home-based rehabilitation, proprioception and neuromuscular training, and six miscellaneous topics investigated in single trials. RESULTS: Bracing following ACL reconstruction remains neither necessary nor beneficial and adds to the cost of the procedure. Early return to sports needs further research. Home-based rehabilitation can be successful. Although neuromuscular interventions are not likely to be harmful to patients, they are also not likely to yield large improvements in outcomes or help patients return to sports faster. Thus, they should not be performed to the exclusion of strengthening and range-of-motion exercises. Vibration training may lead to faster and more complete proprioceptive recovery but further evidence is needed. CONCLUSIONS: Several new modalities for rehabilitation after ACL reconstruction may be helpful but should not be performed to the exclusion of range-of-motion, strengthening, and functional exercises. Accelerated rehabilitation does not appear to be harmful but further investigation of rehabilitation timing is warranted. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level II.

  abstract = {In computational models of human walking, both magnitude and timing of locomotor propulsion are important for mechanical and metabolic efficiency, suggesting that these are likely tightly controlled by the neuromuscular system. Studies of actual human walking have focused primarily on magnitude-related measures of propulsion, often ignoring its timing. The purpose of this study was to quantify the timing of onset and peak propulsion relative to contralateral heel strike (HS) in healthy, young adults walking at multiple speeds. Propulsion was quantified at the groundlevel using the anterior component of the anteroposterior ground reaction force, the limb-level using individual limb power, and the joint-level using ankle power. Contrary to common computational models, most of our timing-related measures indicated that propulsion occurred after contralateral HS. Timing-related measures of propulsion also changed with walking speed -- as speed increased, individuals initiated propulsion earlier in the support phase. Timing of locomotor propulsion is theoretically important for walking performance, especially metabolic efficiency, and could therefore provide important clinical information. This study provides a set of relatively simple metrics that can be used to quantify propulsion and benchmark data that can be used for future comparisons with individuals or populations with gait impairments.},

  abstract = {A healthy gait pattern depends on an array of biomechanical features, orchestrated by the central nervous system for economy and stability. Injuries and other pathologies can alter these features and result in substantial gait deficits, often with detrimental consequences for energy expenditure and balance. An understanding of the role of biomechanics in the generation of healthy gait, therefore, can provide insight into these deficits. This article examines the basic principles of gait from the standpoint of dynamic walking, an approach that combines an inverted pendulum model of the stance leg with a pendulum model of the swing leg and its impact with the ground. The heel-strike at the end of each step has dynamic effects that can contribute to a periodic gait and its passive stability. Biomechanics, therefore, can account for much of the gait pattern, with additional motor inputs that are important for improving economy and stability. The dynamic walking approach can predict the consequences of disruptions to normal biomechanics, and the associated observations can help explain some aspects of impaired gait. This article reviews the basic principles of dynamic walking and the associated experimental evidence for healthy gait and then considers how the principles may be applied to clinical gait pathologies},

  abstract = {Background: Walking speed, which is often reduced after stroke, can be influenced by the perception of optic flow (OF) speed. The present study aims to: 1) compare the modulation of walking speed in response to OF speed changes between persons with stroke and healthy controls and 2) investigate whether virtual environments (VE) manipulating OF speed can be used to promote volitional changes in walking speed post stroke. Methods: Twelve persons with stroke and 12 healthy individuals walked on a self-paced treadmill while viewing a virtual corridor in a helmet-mounted display. Two experiments were carried out on the same day. In experiment 1, the speed of an expanding OF was varied sinusoidally at 0.017 Hz (sine duration = 60 s), from 0 to 2 times the subject's comfortable walking speed, for a total duration of 5 minutes. In experiment 2, subjects were exposed to expanding OFs at discrete speeds that ranged from 0.25 to 2 times their comfortable speed. Each test trial was paired with a control trial performed at comfortable speed with matching OF. For each of the test trials, subjects were instructed to walk the distance within the same time as during the immediately preceding control trial. VEs were controlled by the CAREN-2 system (Motek). Instantaneous changes in gait speed (experiment 1) and the ratio of speed changes in the test trial over the control trial (experiment 2) were contrasted between the two groups of subjects. Results: When OF speed was changing continuously (experiment 1), an out-of-phase modulation was observed in the gait speed of healthy subjects, such that slower OFs induced faster walking speeds, and vice versa. Persons with stroke displayed weaker (p {$<$} 0.05, T-test) correlation coefficients between gait speed and OF speed, due to less pronounced changes and an altered phasing of gait speed modulation. When OF speed was manipulated discretely (experiment 2), a negative linear relationship was generally observed between the test-control ratio of gait speed and OF speed in healthy and stroke individuals. The slope of this relationship was similar between the stroke and healthy groups (p {$>$} 0.05, T-test). Conclusion: Stroke affects the modulation of gait speed in response to changes in the perception of movement through different OF speeds. Nevertheless, the preservation of even a modest modulation enabled the persons with stroke to increase walking speed when presented with slower OFs. Manipulation of OF speed using virtual reality technology could be implemented in a gait rehabilitation intervention to promote faster walking speeds after stroke.},

There is evidence to support rehabilitation in well coordinated multidisciplinary stroke units or through provision of early supported provision of discharge teams. Potentially beneficial treatment options for motor recovery of the arm include constraint-induced movement therapy and robotics. Promising interventions that could be beneficial to improve aspects of gait include fitness training, high-intensity therapy, and repetitive-task training. Repetitive-task training might also improve transfer functions. Occupational therapy can improve activities of daily living; however, information about the clinical effect of various strategies of cognitive rehabilitation and strategies for aphasia and dysarthria is scarce.

Methods: A list of criteria was used to evaluate functional community ambulation among participants. Physiological variables, such as the heart rate, oxygen uptake and the lactate concentration, were also measured. Results: Three of nine incomplete SCI subjects and all able-bodied subjects were able to meet all the criteria measured. The required velocity to safely cross an intersection was the criterion that the incomplete SCI group had the most diculty reaching. The able-bodied subjects had a comfortable walking velocity twice that of the incomplete SCI subjects' preferred velocity. When walking at the same velocity (incomplete SCI subjects' preferred velocity), the incomplete SCI subjects had a rate of oxygen uptake 26\% greater than the healthy subjects and were 200\% less ecient. The lactate concentration also proved to be a useful tool when evaluating the incomplete SCI subjects' walking eciency. The incomplete SCI subjects lactate concentration increased after walking at their preferred velocity, meaning that the anaerobic pathways were used to meet energy demands. Conclusion: Rehabilitation centers should adapt their evaluation forms and increase their criteria requirements to more suitable criteria that are found in the SCI patient's community. The physiological cost should also be taken into consideration when evaluating the SCI patient's functional ambulation.},

  abstract = {Motor control is an area of natural science exploring how the nervous system interacts with other body parts and the environment to produce purposeful, coordinated actions. A central problem of motor control -- the problem of motor redundancy -- was formulated by Nikolai Bernstein as the problem of elimination of redundant degrees-of-freedom. Traditionally, this problem has been addressed using optimization methods based on a variety of cost functions. This review draws attention to a body of recent findings suggesting that the problem has been formulated incorrectly. An alternative view has been suggested as the principle of abundance, which considers the apparently redundant degrees-of-freedom as useful and even vital for many aspects of motor behavior. Over the past ten years, dozens of publications have provided support for this view based on the ideas of synergic control, computational apparatus of the uncontrolled manifold hypothesis, and the equilibrium-point (referent configuration) hypothesis. In particular, large amounts of " good variance " -- variance in the space of elements that has no effect on the overall performance -- have been documented across a variety of natural actions. " Good variance " helps an abundant system to deal with secondary tasks and unexpected perturbations; its amount shows adaptive modulation across a variety of conditions. These data support the view that there is no problem of motor redundancy; there is bliss of motor abundance.},

  abstract = {Identification of gait events using an optimal sensor set and a reliable algorithm would be useful in the clinical evaluation of patients with dropped foot. This article describes a threshold detection method for identifying gait events and evaluating the reliability of a system on ten subjects with dropped foot and three non-impaired controls. The system comprised three sensor units of accelerometers and gyroscopes attached at the thigh, shank and foot of the impaired leg in subjects with dropped foot, and the dominant leg in the controls. A performance index was devised to compare the values of different measuring directions of the sensor units and evaluate the system's reliability. The performance index, with the ideal value equal to 1, depended on the classification accuracy and timing variation of the turning points. These were obtained from the threshold detection method that distinguished the absolute maximum and minimum turning points from local maximum and minimum turning points. It was found that some specific turning points could effectively identify gait events with a high median value in the performance index. These turning points included: the minimum turning point in superior--inferior acceleration on the thigh at loading response (0.972); the minimum turning point in anterior--posterior angular velocity on the shank at pre-swing (0.955) and the maximum turning point in superior--inferior acceleration on the foot at initial swing (0.954). Combining the results of sensor measurements in different orientations and attachment locations could be used for gait event identification. It was shown that the threshold detection method is reliable. Portable gait-monitoring devices can be used for monitoring of daily activities and functional control.},

  abstract = {Review question We wanted to compare the effects of virtual reality versus an alternative treatment or no treatment on recovery after stroke using arm function and other outcomes such as walking speed and independence in managing daily activities after stroke. Background Many people after having a stroke have difficulty moving, thinking, and sensing. This often results in problems with everyday activities such as writing, walking, and driving. Virtual reality and interactive video gaming are types of therapy being provided to people after having a stroke. The therapy involves using computer-based programs designed to simulate real life objects and events. Virtual reality and interactive video gaming may have some advantages over traditional therapy approaches as they can give people an opportunity to practise everyday activities that are not or cannot be practised within the hospital environment. Furthermore, there are several features of virtual reality programs that might mean that patients spend more time in therapy: for example, the activity might be more motivating. Study characteristics We identified 72 studies involving 2470 people after stroke. A wide range of virtual reality programs were used, with most aimed to improve either arm function or walking ability. The evidence is current to April 2017. Key results Twenty-two trials tested whether the use of virtual reality compared with conventional therapy resulted in an improved ability to use one's arm and found that the use of virtual reality did not result in better function (low-quality evidence). When virtual reality was used in addition to usual care or rehabilitation to increase the amount of time the person spent in therapy there were improvements in the functioning of the arm (low-quality evidence). Six trials tested whether the use of virtual reality compared with conventional therapy resulted in improved walking speed. There was no evidence that virtual reality was more effective in this case (low-quality evidence). Ten trials found that there was some evidence that virtual reality resulted in a slightly better ability to manage everyday activities such as showering and dressing (moderate-quality evidence). However, these positive effects were found soon after the end of the treatment and it is not clear whether the effects are long lasting. Results should be interpreted with caution as, while there are a large number of studies, the studies are generally small and not of high quality. A small number of people using virtual reality reported pain, headaches, or dizziness. No serious adverse events were reported. Quality of the evidence The quality of the evidence was generally of low or moderate quality. The quality of the evidence for each outcome was limited due to small numbers of study participants, inconsistent results across studies, and poor reporting of study details.},

Purpose: There is clear evidence that physical activity, including walking, has substantial benefits for health. This article, prepared as part of the proceedings of a conference on walking and health, discusses the type of walking that produces substantial health benefits, considers several methodological issues pertinent to epidemiologic studies investigating the association of walking and health, and reviews some of the reasons for the large public health importance of walking. Methods: Review of the available literature. Due to space constraints, this is not intended to be a comprehensive review; instead, selected studies are cited to illustrate the points raised. Results: Walking as a healthful form of physical activity began to receive attention in the 1990s due to new recommendations that emphasized moderate-intensity physical activity. The main example of moderate-intensity activity in the 1995 Centers for Disease Control/American College of Sports Medicine recommendation was brisk walking at 3 to 4 mph. Evidence for the health benefits of walking comes largely from epidemiologic studies. When interpreting the data from such studies, it is necessary to consider several methodological issues, including the design of the study, confounding by other lifestyle behaviors, and confounding by other kinds of physical activity. Walking has the potential to have a large public health impact due to its accessibility, its documented health benefits, and the fact that effective programs to promote walking already exist. Conclusions: Walking is a simple health behavior that can reduce rates of chronic disease and ameliorate rising health care costs, with only a modest increase in the number of activity-related injuries.},

  abstract = {The use of body weight support (BWS) systems during locomotor retraining has become routine in clinical settings. BWS alters load receptor feedback, however, and may alter the biomechanical role of the ankle plantarflexors, influencing gait. The purpose of this study was to characterize the biomechanical adaptations that occur as a result of a change in limb load (controlled indirectly through BWS) and gait speed during treadmill locomotion. Fifteen unimpaired participants underwent gait analysis with surface electromyography while walking on an instrumented dual-belt treadmill at seven different speeds (ranging from 0.4 to 1.6 m/s) and three BWS conditions (ranging from 0\% to 40\% BWS). While walking, spatiotemporal measures, anterior/posterior ground reaction forces, and ankle kinetics and muscle activity were measured and compared between conditions. At slower gait speeds, propulsive forces and ankle kinetics were unaffected by changing BWS; however, at gait speeds Z approximately 0.8 m/s, an increase in BWS yielded reduced propulsive forces and diminished ankle plantarflexor moments and powers. Muscle activity remained unaltered by changing BWS across all gait speeds. The use of BWS could provide the advantage of faster walking speeds with the same push-off forces as required of a slower speed. While the use of BWS at slower speeds does not appear to detrimentally affect gait, it may be important to reduce BWS as participants progress with training, to encourage maximal push-off forces. The reduction in plantarflexor kinetics at higher speeds suggests that the use of BWS in higher functioning individuals may impair the ability to relearn walking.},

This study was designed to determine if multi-session balance training with and without biofeedback leads to changes in balance performance in healthy older adults; and if changes persist after training. 36 participants (age 60--88) were randomly divided into two groups. Both groups trained on seven stance and gait tasks for 2 consecutive weeks (3{\^A}/ week) while trunk angular sway and task duration were monitored. One group received real-time multimodal biofeedback of trunk sway and a control group trained without biofeedback. Training effects were assessed at the last training session, with biofeedback available to the feedback group. Post-training effects (without biofeedback) were assessed immediately after, 1-week, and 1-month post-training. Both groups demonstrated training effects; participants swayed less when standing on foam with eyes closed (EC), maintained tandem-stance EC longer, and completed 8 tandem-steps EC faster and with less sway at the last training session. Changes in sway and duration, indicative of faster walking, were also observed after training for other gait tasks. While changes in walking speed persisted post-training, few other post-training effects were observed. These data suggest there is little added benefit to balance training with biofeedback, beyond training without, in healthy older adults. However, transient use of wearable balance biofeedback systems as balance aides remains beneficial for challenging balance situations and some clinical populations.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have reported the application of artificial neural network (ANN) techniques on data of inertial measurement units (IMUs) to predict ground reaction forces (GRFs), which could serve as quantitative indicators of sports performance or rehabilitation. The number of IMUs and their measurement locations are often determined heuristically, and the rationale underlying the selection of these parameter values is not discussed. Using the dynamic relationship between the center of mass (CoM), the GRFs and joint kinetics, we propose the CoM as a single measurement location with which to predict the dynamic data of the lower limbs, using an ANN. Data from seven subjects walking on a treadmill at various speeds were collected from a single IMU worn near the sacrum. The data was segmented by step and numerically processed for integration. Six segment angles of the stance and swing leg, three joint torques, and two GRFs were estimated from the kinematics of the CoM measured from a single IMU sensor, with fair accuracy. These results indicate the importance of the CoM as a dynamic determinant of multi-segment kinetics during walking. The tradeoff between data quantity and wearable convenience can be solved by utilizing a machine learning algorithm based on the dynamic characteristics of human walking.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE This study compared the responsiveness and criterion-related validity of the Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) and Stroke-Specific Quality of Life Scale (SS-QOL) for patients after stroke rehabilitation. METHODS The SIS and SS-QOL, along with five criterion measures-the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, the Motor Activity Log, the Functional Independence Measure, the Frenchay Activities Index, and the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living Scale-were administered to 74 patients with stroke before and after a 3-week intervention. Responsiveness was examined using the Wilcoxon signed rank test and standardized response mean (SRM). Criterion-related validity was investigated using the Spearman correlation coefficient (rho). RESULTS Whereas the SS-QOL subscales were nonresponsive to changes, the SIS hand function showed medium responsiveness (SRM = .52, Wilcoxon Z = 4.24, P {$<$} .05). Responsiveness of the SIS total also was significantly larger than that of the SS-QOL total (SRM difference, .36; 95\% confidence interval, .02-.71). Criterion validity of the SIS hand function was good (rho = .51-.68; P {$<$} .01), but that of the SS-QOL was only fair (rho = .25-.31; P {$<$} .05). CONCLUSION Because the SIS had better overall responsiveness and the SIS hand function showed medium responsiveness and good criterion validity, the SIS appears to be more suited for assessing changes after stroke rehabilitation.},

  abstract = {Rapid unloading and a peak in power output of the ankle joint have been widely observed during push-off in human walking. Modelbased studies hypothesize that this push-off causes redirection of the body center of mass just before touch-down of the leading leg. Other research suggests that work done by the ankle extensors provides kinetic energy for the initiation of swing. Also, muscle work is suggested to power a catapult-like action in late stance of human walking. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the biomechanical process leading to this widely observed high power output of the ankle extensors. In our study, we use kinematic and dynamic data of human walking collected at speeds between 0.5 and 2.5\,m\,s-1 for a comprehensive analysis of push-off mechanics. We identify two distinct phases, which divide the push-off: first, starting with positive ankle power output, an alleviation phase, where the trailing leg is alleviated from supporting the body mass, and second, a launching phase, where stored energy in the ankle joint is released. Our results show a release of just a small part of the energy stored in the ankle joint during the alleviation phase. A larger impulse for the trailing leg than for the remaining body is observed during the launching phase. Here, the buckling knee joint inhibits transfer of power from the ankle to the remaining body. It appears that swing initiation profits from an impulsive ankle push-off resulting from a catapult without escapement.},

This clinically observable sign, frequently referred to as 'foot drop', ostensibly results from dorsiflexor weakness.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nOBJECTIVE: Here we investigated the extent to which hip, knee, and ankle motions contribute to impaired paretic limb advancement. We hypothesized that neither: 1) minimal toe clearance and maximal limb shortening during swing nor, 2) the pattern of multiple joint contributions to toe clearance and limb shortening would differ between post-stroke and non-disabled control groups.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: We studied 16 individuals post-stroke during overground walking at self-selected speed and nine non-disabled controls who walked at matched speeds using 3D motion analysis.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: No differences were detected with respect to the ankle dorsiflexion contribution to toe clearance post-stroke. Rather, hip flexion had a greater relative influence, while the knee flexion influence on producing toe clearance was reduced.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: Similarity in the ankle dorsiflexion, but differences in the hip and knee, contributions to toe clearance between groups argues strongly against dorsiflexion dysfunction as the fundamental impairment of limb advancement post-stroke. Marked reversal in the roles of hip and knee flexion indicates disruption of inter-joint coordination, which most likely results from impairment of the dynamic contribution to knee flexion by the gastrocnemius muscle in preparation for swing. These findings suggest the need to reconsider the notion of foot drop in persons post-stroke. Redirecting the focus of rehabilitation and restoration of hemiparetic walking dysfunction appropriately, towards contributory neuromechanical impairments, will improve outcomes and reduce disability.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a study on development of a wearable sensor system for quantitative gait analysis using inertial sensors of gyroscopes and accelerometers. This system was designed to detect gait phases including initial contact, loading response, mid stance, terminal stance, pre swing, initial swing, mid swing and terminal swing, which is quite inexpensive compared with conventional 3D motion analysis systems based on high-speed cameras. Since conventional camera-based systems require costly devices, vast space as well as time-consuming calibration experiments, the wearable sensor-based system is much cheaper. Gyroscopes (ENC-05EB) and two-axis ADXL202 accelerometers are incorporated in this wearable sensor system. The former are attached on the surface of the foot, shank and thigh to measure the angular velocity of each segment, and the latter are used to measure inclination of the attached leg segment (shank) in every single human motion cycle for recalibration. The gyroscope is sensitive to a temperature change or small changes in the structure (mechanical wear), which leads to fluctuating offsets from sensor output in applications of human motion measurements. The orientation estimation algorithm here continuously corrects orientation estimates obtained by mathematical integration of the angular velocity measured using the gyroscopes. Correction is performed using an inclination estimation obtained using the signal of the two-axis accelerometer during the interval of mid stance in each stride. The average of root mean squared error (RMSE) was not over 5.0{$^\circ$} (the thigh angle orientation) when the calibration was implemented. Correlation coefficient (R) approached 0.9 when the segment angles obtained from the wearable sensor system were compared with the results from a conventional optical motion analysis system.},

  abstract = {A new method using a double-sensor difference based algorithm for analyzing human segment rotational angles in two directions for segmental orientation analysis in the three-dimensional (3D) space was presented. A wearable sensor system based only on triaxial accelerometers was developed to obtain the pitch and yaw angles of thigh segment with an accelerometer approximating translational acceleration of the hip joint and two accelerometers measuring the actual accelerations on the thigh. To evaluate the method, the system was first tested on a 21 of freedom mechanical arm assembled out of rigid segments and encoders. Then, to estimate the human segmental orientation, the wearable sensor system was tested on the thighs of eight volunteer subjects, who walked in a straight forward line in the work space of an optical motion analysis system at three self-selected speeds: slow, normal and fast. In the experiment, the subject was assumed to walk in a straight forward way with very little trunk sway, skin artifacts and no significant internal/external rotation of the leg. The root mean square (RMS) errors of the thigh segment orientation measurement were between 2.41 and 4.91 during normal gait that had a 451 flexion/extension range of motion. Measurement error was observed to increase with increasing walking speed probably because of the result of increased trunk sway, axial rotation and skin artifacts. The results show that, without integration and switching between different sensors, using only one kind of sensor, the wearable sensor system is suitable for ambulatory analysis of normal gait orientation of thigh and shank in two directions of the segment-fixed local coordinate system in 3D space. It can then be applied to assess spatio-temporal gait parameters and monitoring the gait function of patients in clinical settings.},

Our previous work demonstrated that the use of an audiovisual biofeedback interface designed to increase paretic leg propulsion, measured via anterior ground reaction force (AGRF) generation during late stance phase of gait, can induce improvements in peak AGRF production of the targeted and paretic limb of able-bodied and post-stroke individuals, respectively. However, whether different modes of biofeedback, such as visual, auditory, or a combination of both, have differential effects on AGRF generation is unknown. The present study investigated the effects of audio only, visual only, or audiovisual AGRF biofeedback in able-bodied and post-stroke individuals. Seven able-bodied (6 females, 27\,{\textpm}\,2 years) and nine post-stroke individuals (6 females, 54\,{\textpm}\,12 years, 42\,{\textpm}\,26 months post-stroke) completed four 30-s walking trials on a treadmill under 4 conditions: no biofeedback, audio biofeedback, visual biofeedback, or audiovisual biofeedback. Compared to walking without biofeedback, all three biofeedback modes significantly increased peak AGRF in the targeted and paretic leg. There was no significant difference in peak AGRF between the three biofeedback modes. Able-bodied individuals demonstrated greater feedback-induced increase in stride-to-stride variation of AGRF generation during audio biofeedback compared to visual biofeedback; however, similar results were not observed in the post-stroke group. The present findings may inform future development of real-time gait biofeedback interfaces for use in clinical or community environments.},

Using a simple biomechanical model, a delayed-feedback rule based on an optimal tradeoff between postural error and neural effort explained patterns of muscle activation in response to a sudden loss of balance in cats. Following the loss of large sensory afferents, changes in these muscle-activation patterns reflected an optimal reweighting of sensory feedback gains to minimize postural instability. Specifically, a loss of center-of-mass-acceleration information, which allowed for a rapid initial rise in the muscle activity in intact animals, was absent after large-fiber sensory neuropathy. Our results demonstrate that a simple and flexible neural feedback control strategy coordinates multiple muscles over time via a small set of extrinsic, task-level variables during complex multijoint natural movements.},

Engineering models of biological motor control often oversimplify or even ignore these lower levels because they appear to complicate an already difficult problem. We modeled three highly simplified control systems that reflect the essential attributes of the lower levels in three tasks: acquiring a target in the face of random torque-pulse perturbations, optimizing fusimotor gain for the same perturbations, and minimizing postural error versus energy consumption during low- versus high-frequency perturbations. The emergent properties of the lower levels maintained stability in the face of feedback delays, resolved redundancy in over-complete systems, and helped to estimate loads and respond to perturbations. We suggest a general hierarchical approach to modeling sensorimotor systems, which better reflects the real control problem faced by the brain, as a first step toward identifying the actual neurocomputational steps and their anatomical partitioning in the brain.},

The technological component of the intervention is based on a wearable footwear-based sensor system that monitors relative activity levels, functional utilization, and gait parameters of affected and unaffected lower extremities. The purpose of this study is to describe a methodology to automatically identify temporal gait parameters of poststroke individuals to be used in assessment of functional utilization of the affected lower extremity as a part of behavior enhancing feedback. An algorithm accounting for intersubject variability is capable of achieving estimation error in the range of 2.6-18.6\% producing comparable results for healthy and poststroke subjects.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Common locomotor deficits observed in individuals post-stroke include decreased speeds and abnormal kinematics, characterized by altered symmetry, reduced sagittal-plane joint excursions, and use of compensatory frontal-plane behaviors during the swing phase. Conventional interventions utilized to mitigate these deficits often incorporate low-intensity, impairment-based or functional exercises focused on normalizing kinematics, although the efficacy of these strategies is unclear. Conversely, higher intensity training protocols that provide only stepping practice and do not focus on kinematics have demonstrated gains in walking function, although minimal attention towards gait quality may be concerning and has not been assessed. OBJECTIVE The present study evaluated changes in spatiotemporal and joint kinematics following experimental, high intensity stepping training as compared to conventional interventions. DESIGN Kinematic data were combined from a randomized trial comparing experimental and conventional training, and from a pilot experimental training study. METHODS Individuals with gait deficits 1-6 months post-stroke received up to 40 sessions of either high-intensity stepping training in variable contexts or conventional lower intensity interventions. Analyses focused on kinematic changes during graded treadmill testing before and following training. RESULTS Significant improvements in speed, symmetry and selected sagittal kinematics favored experimental vs conventional training, although increases in compensatory strategies were also observed. Changes in many kinematic patterns were correlated with speed changes, and increased compensatory behaviors were associated with both stride length gains and baseline impairments. LIMITATIONS Limitations include a small sample size and use of multiple statistical comparisons. CONCLUSIONS Improved speeds and selected kinematics were observed following high-intensity training, but also resulted in increased use of compensatory strategies. Future studies should explore the consequences of utilizing these compensatory strategies despite the observed functional gains.},

  abstract = {Background: Even though walking can be sustained for great distances, considerable energy is required for plantarflexion around the instant of opposite leg heel contact. Different groups attempted to reduce metabolic cost with exoskeletons but none could achieve a reduction beyond the level of walking without exoskeleton, possibly because there is no consensus on the optimal actuation timing. The main research question of our study was whether it is possible to obtain a higher reduction in metabolic cost by tuning the actuation timing. Methodology/Principal Findings: We measured metabolic cost by means of respiratory gas analysis. Test subjects walked with a simple pneumatic exoskeleton that assists plantarflexion with different actuation timings. We found that the exoskeleton can reduce metabolic cost by 0.1860.06 W kg21 or 662\% (standard error of the mean) (p = 0.019) below the cost of walking without exoskeleton if actuation starts just before opposite leg heel contact. Conclusions/Significance: The optimum timing that we found concurs with the prediction from a mathematical model of walking. While the present exoskeleton was not ambulant, measurements of joint kinetics reveal that the required power could be recycled from knee extension deceleration work that occurs naturally during walking. This demonstrates that it is theoretically possible to build future ambulant exoskeletons that reduce metabolic cost, without power supply restrictions.},

This was examined by comparing knee moments determined from bone-anchored and surface mounted tracking targets. Six healthy adult subjects participated in this study. The largest difference (3 N m) occurred about the AP axis, with smaller differences of approximately 2 and 1 N m about the flexion/extension (F/E) and longitudinal (Long) axes, respectively. The magnitude of these differences would not likely affect the clinical interpretation of the data. The effect of reporting knee moments in two different orthogonal reference systems was also examined. The peak extension moment was significantly greater when expressed about an anatomical axis following the line of the malleoli than when the moment was reported about an axis parallel to the frontal plane of the shank. In contrast, the first peak abduction moment was significantly greater when expressed about an axis perpendicular to the frontal plane of the shank. Care should therefore be exercised whenever comparisons between studies are made in which the reference axes are not aligned. {\copyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

A simple four-state left-right HMM is trained on a dataset of signals collected from a mono-axial gyro during treadmill walking trials performed at different speed and incline values. The gyro is mounted at the foot instep, with its sensitivity axis oriented in the medio-lateral direction. A rule based method applied to gyro signals is used for data annotation. Sensitivity and specificity of phase classification detection higher than 95\% are obtained.

Four subjects wore an accelerometer over their lumbar spine. Footswitches placed on the sole of one foot recorded the heel contact and heel off times for that foot. The acceleration signal was reduced to a series of pulses by studying the negative--positive changes in acceleration. It was found that there was approximately a 150 ms delay between heel contact and the negative--positive change in acceleration. This delay was consistent across different walking speeds, but was different between subjects and when hemiplegic gait was simulated. Therefore, accelerometers placed on the trunk are valid sensors for the detection of heel contact events during FES assisted walking.},

Comprehensive assessment of physical and mental impairments should include aspects beyond medical conditions such as a person's underlying capabilities as well as activity demands relevant to the context of work. The objective of this article is to describe the initial conceptual stages of developing new measurement instruments of behavioral health and physical functioning relevant for Social Security work disability evaluation purposes. To outline a clear conceptualization of the constructs to be measured, 2 content models were developed using structured and informal qualitative approaches. We performed a structured literature review focusing on work disability and incorporating aspects of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health as a unifying taxonomy for framework development. Expert interviews provided advice and consultation to enhance face validity of the resulting content models. The content model for work-related behavioral health function identifies 5 major domains: (1) behavior control, (2) basic interactions, (3) temperament and personality, (4) adaptability, and (5) workplace behaviors. The content model describing physical functioning includes 3 domains: (1) changing and maintaining body position, (2) whole-body mobility, and (3) carrying, moving, and handling objects. These content models informed subsequent measurement properties including item development and measurement scale construction, and provided conceptual coherence guiding future empirical inquiry. The proposed measurement approaches show promise to comprehensively and systematically assess physical and behavioral health functioning relevant to work. {\copyright} 2013 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.},

An anatomic study should have to address, its biomechanical properties, its kinematics, its position and anatomic correlation and its functional properties. In this review, an attempt is made to summarize the most recent and authoritative tendencies as far as the anatomy of the ACL, and its surgical application in its reconstruction are concerned. Also, it is significant to take into account the anatomy as far as the rehabilitation protocol is concerned. Separate placement in the femoral side is known to give better results from transtibial approach. The medial tibial eminence and the intermeniscal ligament may be used as landmarks to guide the correct tunnel placement in anatomic ACL reconstruction. The anatomic centrum of the ACL femoral footprint is 43 \% of the proximal-to-distal length of lateral, femoral intercondylar notch wall and femoral socket radius plus 2.5 mm anterior to the posterior articular margin. Some important factors affecting the surgical outcome of ACL reconstruction include graft selection, tunnel placement, initial graft tension, graft fixation, graft tunnel motion and healing. The rehabilitation protocol should come in phases in order to increase range of motion, muscle strength and leg balance, it should protect the graft and weightbearing should come in stages. The cornerstones of such a protocol remain bracing, controlling edema, pain and range of motion. This should be useful and valuable information in achieving full range of motion and stability of the knee postoperatively. In the end, all these advancements will contribute to better patient outcome. Recommendations point toward further experimental work with in vivo and in vitro studies, in order to assist in the development of new surgical procedures that could possibly replicate more closely the natural ACL anatomy and prevent future knee pathology.},

Initiation of gait requires transitions from relatively stationary positions to stability with movement and from double- to single-limb stances. These are deliberately destabilizing activities that may be difficult for people with early Parkinson disease (PD), even when they have no problems with level walking. We studied differences in postural stability during gait initiation between participants with early and middle stages of PD (characterized by Hoehn and Yahr as stages 1--3) and 2 other groups of participants without PD---older and younger adults. Subjects. The mean ages of the 3 groups of participants were as follows: subjects with PD, 69.3 years (SD=5.7, range=59--78); older subjects without PD, 69.0 years (SD=3.9, range=65--79); and younger subjects without PD, 27.5 (SD=3.9, range=22--35). Methods. A 3-dimensional motion analysis system was used with 2 force platforms to obtain data for center of mass (COM) and center of pressure (COP). The distance between the vertical projections of the COM and the COP (COM--COP distance) was used to reflect postural control during 5 events in gait initiation. Results. By use of multivariate analysis of variance, differences in COM--COP distance were found among the 3 groups. An analysis of variance indicated differences for 4 of the 5 events in gait initiation. A Scheffe post hoc analysis demonstrated differences in gait initiation between the subjects with PD and both groups of subjects without PD (2 events) and between the subjects with PD and the younger subjects without PD (2 events). Discussion and Conclusion. The COM--COP distance relationship was used to measure postural control during the transition from quiet standing to steady-state gait. Differences between groups indicated that individuals with impaired postural control allow less COM--COP distance than do individuals with no known neurologic problems. The method used could prove useful in the development and assessment of interventions to improve ambulation safety and enhance the independence of people with impaired postural control.},

These considerations have generated various conceptual models, some of which share the same focus and point of arrival, the so-called 'Disablement Process'. Among the models that were developed, two stand out, which were drafted and disseminated under the aegis of the World Health Organization, namely the International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps (ICIDH) and the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF), but these are just one part of the conceptual elaboration in the field. Further conceptualization was produced in health and social settings by specialists, self-advocacy associations and activist groups.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: The current ICF model of the World Health Organization has been translated and recognized in 191 countries; it also incorporates the contribution of self-advocacy associations and it is now recognized by most of them. This model has enjoyed higher visibility than other conceptual models, though its level of development was not higher or more original. To our opinion the ICF is not very clear on the essential choice of the model, i.e., to see disablement as a dynamic process that happens when personal limits collide with socio-environmental needs, rather than as a personal feature. This choice is instead clearer in other models, like Nagi's 1991, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) model by Brandt and Pope, where the identification of three dimensions (the individual, the environment and the individual-environment interaction) clarifies the role played by all three dimensions within the process of disablement and introduces major hints for further considerations on how to create virtuous processes of enablement.},

The detected gait parameters are as follows: stance (ST), double support (DS), and gait cycle (GC) time as temporal parameters, and the stride length (SL) as spatial parameter. Four motion sensors are attached on both thighs and shanks of users, and the sensor data are collected in a portable PC. The temporal parameters are estimated by finding walking events, and then the stride length is calculated with two gait models. The estimated parameters are compared to those obtained from a motion capture system (VICON system)},

  abstract = {Degeneracy is a word with two meanings. The popular usage of the word denotes deviance and decay. In scientific discourse, degeneracy refers to the idea that different pathways can lead to the same output. In the biological sciences, the concept of degeneracy has been ignored for a few key reasons. Firstly, the word "degenerate" in popular culture has negative, emotionally powerful associations that do not inspire scientists to consider its technical meaning. Secondly, the tendency of searching for single causes of natural and social phenomena means that scientists can overlook the multi-stranded relationships between cause and effect. Thirdly, degeneracy and redundancy are often confused with each other. Degeneracy refers to dissimilar structures that are functionally similar while redundancy refers to identical structures. Degeneracy can give rise to novelty in ways that redundancy cannot. From genetic codes to immunology, vaccinology and brain development, degeneracy is a crucial part of how complex systems maintain their functional integrity. This review article discusses how the scientific concept of degeneracy was imported into genetics from physics and was later introduced to immunology and neuroscience. Using examples of degeneracy in immunology, neuroscience and linguistics, we demonstrate that degeneracy is a useful way of understanding how complex systems function. Reviewing the history and theoretical scope of degeneracy allows its usefulness to be better appreciated, its coherency to be further developed, and its application to be more quickly realized.},

  abstract = {Human walking has a peculiar straight-legged style. Consequently, the body's centre of mass (CM) moves up and down with each step, which is noticeable in their up and down head bobbing while walking. This vertical CM movement enables humans to save energy via a pendulum-like mechanism but is probably a relatively recent locomotor innovation insofar as earliest bipeds may have walked flexed and flat. We investigated the mechanics, energetics, muscle efficiency and optimization of human walking by decreasing and increasing the vertical CM displacement (flat and bouncy walking) in comparison to normal walking at six speeds (1--6 km h-1). In both flat and bouncy walking, the pendular mechanism was reduced and the energy cost was increased. However, this increase was unexpectedly much sharper in flat walking where muscles provided normal mechanical work but with a decrease in muscle efficiency. In bouncy walking, muscles provided extra mechanical work in an efficient way. Our results showed that not only do humans bob up and down in normal walking to save energy via a pendulum-like mechanism but also to make their muscles work efficiently. Actually, walking flat makes the muscles work in unfavourable conditions that waste energy. Furthermore, we are still close to a flat CM displacement relative to our current ability to change this displacement, which suggests that reducing vertical CM displacement is indeed important but only to certain limits. Evolution may ultimately have chosen the best compromise between flat locomotion that requires little work to move and bouncy locomotion that improves muscle efficiency to minimize energy consumption.},

  abstract = {Background.Hemiparetic gait following stroke requires substantial energy consumption,which would promote deconditioning and disability. Optimal modalities for decreasing this energy cost remain challenging. Excessive energy consumption, however, seems to be mainly due to extra positive muscle work to substantially lift the body's center of mass (CM) against gravity during the paretic limb swing. Objective. The authors tested a new rehabilitation strategy in a pilot study to specifically reduce the energy cost in hemiparetic gait. Methods. Six chronic hemiparetic patients underwent a 6-week gait training program on a treadmill with real-time feedback of their CM and were asked to reduce its increased vertical displacement. The authors assessed the walking energy cost, vertical CM displacement, kinematics, and electromyogram activity without feedback before and after treatment. Results. After treatment, the vertical CM displacement decreased by 10\% (P = .005), particularly when the CM vaulted over the nonparetic limb in stance, and the energy cost decreased markedly by 30\% (P = .009).The paretic knee flexion in swing increased concomitantly by 45\% and muscle co-contraction decreased significantly in both thigh muscles by 15\%. Conclusions.The rehabilitation approach followed in this study seems remarkably effective in decreasing the walking energy cost. By treating the compensatory strategy (ie, the increased CM displacement), we also appear to treat primary deviations such as poststroke knee impairments, which is novel and complementary to current concepts in rehabilitation.This new approach is promising and merits further investigation.},

It consisted of four uniaxial seismic accelerometers and one rate gyroscope per body segment. Tests were done with 10 young healthy volunteers, walking at five different speeds on a treadmill. In order to study the system's accuracy, measurements were made with an optic, passive-marker system and the body-mounted system, simultaneously. In all the comparison cases, the curves obtained from the two systems were very close, showing root mean square errors representing o7\% full range in 75\% of the cases (overall mean 6.64\%, standard deviation 4.13\%) and high coefficients of multiple correlation in 100\% of cases (overall mean 0.9812, standard deviation 0.02). Calibration of the body-mounted system is done against gravity. The body-mounted sensors do not hinder natural movement. The calculation algorithms are computationally demanding and only are applicable off-line. The body-mounted sensors are accurate, inexpensive and portable and allow long-term recordings in clinical, sport and ergonomics settings. r 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Rather imperceptibly, a new way of thinking began to spread through biology soon after the be-ginning of the nineteenth century. It is now most often referred to as population thinking. What its roots were is not at all clear, but the emphasis of animal and plant breeders on the distinct properties of individuals was clearly influential. The other major influence seems to have come from systematics. Naturalists and collectors realized increasingly often that there are individual differences in collected series of animals, corresponding to the kind of differences one would find in a group of human beings. Population thinking, despite its immense importance, spread rather slowly, except in those branches of biology that deal with natural populations. In systematics it became a way of life in the second half of the nineteenth century, particularly in the systematics of the better-known groups of animals, such as birds, mammals, fishes, butter-flies, carabid beetles, and land snails. Collectors were urged to gather large samples at many local-ities, and the variation within populations was studied as assiduously as differences between localities. From systematics, population thinking spread, through the Russian school, to popula-tion genetics and to evolutionary biology. By and large it was an empirical approach with little explicit recognition of the rather revolutionary change in conceptualization on which it rested. So far as I know, the following essay, excerpted from a paper originally published in 1959, was the first presentation of the contrast between essentialist and population thinking, the first full articulation of this revolutionary change in the philosophy of biology. The year of publication of Darwin's Origin of Species, 1859, is rightly considered the year in which the modern science of evolution was born. It must not be forgotten, however, that preceding this zero year of history there was a long prehistory. Yet, despite the existence in 1859 of a widespread belief in evolution, much published evi-dence on its course, and numerous speculations on its causation, the impact of Dar-win's publication was so immense that it ushered in a completely new era. It seems to me that the significance of the scientific contribution made by Darwin is threefold:},

  abstract = {Background: Ankle exoskeletons offer a promising opportunity to offset mechanical deficits after stroke by applying the needed torque at the paretic ankle. Because joint torque is related to gait speed, it is important to consider the user's gait speed when determining the magnitude of assistive joint torque. We developed and tested a novel exoskeleton controller for delivering propulsive assistance which modulates exoskeleton torque magnitude based on both soleus muscle activity and walking speed. The purpose of this research is to assess the impact of the resulting exoskeleton assistance on post-stroke walking performance across a range of walking speeds. Methods: Six participants with stroke walked with and without assistance applied to a powered ankle exoskeleton on the paretic limb. Walking speed started at 60\% of their comfortable overground speed and was increased each minute (n00, n01, n02, etc.). We measured lower limb joint and limb powers, metabolic cost of transport, paretic and non-paretic limb propulsion, and trailing limb angle. Results: Exoskeleton assistance increased with walking speed, verifying the speed-adaptive nature of the controller. Both paretic ankle joint power and total limb power increased significantly with exoskeleton assistance at six walking speeds (n00, n01, n02, n03, n04, n05). Despite these joint- and limb-level benefits associated with exoskeleton assistance, no subject averaged metabolic benefits were evident when compared to the unassisted condition. Both paretic trailing limb angle and integrated anterior paretic ground reaction forces were reduced with assistance applied as compared to no assistance at four speeds (n00, n01, n02, n03). Conclusions: Our results suggest that despite appropriate scaling of ankle assistance by the exoskeleton controller, suboptimal limb posture limited the conversion of exoskeleton assistance into forward propulsion. Future studies could include biofeedback or verbal cues to guide users into limb configurations that encourage the conversion of mechanical power at the ankle to forward propulsion.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The use of steady state as the endpoint for performance of indirect calorimetry (IC) is controversial. We designed this prospective study to evaluate the necessity and significance of achieving steady state. METHODS: Patients with respiratory failure placed on mechanical ventilation in a short- or long-term acute care unit at any 1 of 3 university-based urban hospitals were eligible for the study. The 24-hour total energy expenditure (TEE) was determined by a Nellcor Puritan Bennett 7250 continuous IC monitor. Measured gas exchange parameters were obtained and averaged every 1 minute for the initial hour and then every 15 minutes for the next 23 hours. Over the initial hour, resting energy expenditure (REE) was averaged for intervals over the first 20, 30, 40, and 60 minutes, and for various definitions of steady state where oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide production (VCO2) changed by {$<$}10\%, 15\%, and 20\%. Coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated for VO2 over the first 30 minutes of study. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (mean age, 52.8 years, 59\% male, mean Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE III) score 42.0) were entered in the study. The best correlation between short-term ``snapshot'' REE and the 24-hour TEE was achieved by the steady-state period defined by the most stringent criteria (change in VO2 and VCO2 by {$<$}10\%). The average REE for all steady-state and interval periods correlated significantly to TEE with no significant difference in the absolute values for REE and TEE. Adding 10\% for an activity factor to the average REE for each steady-state and interval period again correlated to TEE in a similar fashion with the same R value, but the absolute values for REE + 10\% for all steady-state and interval periods were significantly different than the corresponding TEE. In those patients with less variation (CV for VO2 {$<$} or = 9.0), the REE obtained for the steady-state period defined by the most stringent criteria still had the best correlation, but similar correlation could be obtained by interval testing of {$>$} or = 30-minute duration. In those patients with greater variation (CV for VO2 {$>$}9.0), interval testing of at least 60 minutes or more was required to attain levels of correlation similar to that achieved by the steady-state period defined by the most stringent criteria. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the use of steady state, best defined as an interval of 5 consecutive minutes whereby VO2 and VCO2 change by {$<$}10\%. The mean REE from this period correlates best to the 24-hour TEE regardless of CV. IC testing can be completed after achievement of steady state. Activity factors of 10\% to 15\% should not be added to the steady-state REE, because this practice significantly decreases the accuracy. In patients who fail to achieve steady state, the CV helps to determine the appropriate duration of IC testing. In those patients with a low CV ({$<$} or = 9.0), 30-minute test duration is adequate. In patients with CV {$>$}9.0, test duration of at least 60 minutes may be required. These latter patients should be considered for 24-hour IC testing.},

  abstract = {Miniature inertial measurement units (IMUs) have become popular in the field of biomechanics as an alternative to expensive and cumbersome video-based motion capture (MOCAP). IMUs provide three-axis sensing of angular velocity and linear acceleration in lieu of position data provided by MOCAP. The research presented herein further explores the use of IMUs in five applications for sports training and clinical biomechanics.The first study focuses on the sports of baseball and softball and yields estimates of the release velocity of a pitched ball within 4.6\% of MOCAP measurements. The ball angular velocity further distinguishes and quantifies different types of pitches. The second study enables estimates of angular velocity during free-flight based solely on data from an embedded tri-axial accelerometer. Doing so eliminates angular rate gyros, which are often range limited, yet yields angular velocity estimates accurate to within 2\%. We further exploit this technique to reveal the rotational stability of rigid bodies in free-flight. The third study extends the use of IMUs to assess the speed of an athlete estimated from a torso-mounted IMU. The speed estimates remain highly correlated with those obtained by MOCAP (r=0.96, slope=0.99) for motions characteristic of explosive sports (e.g., basketball). Moreover, the accurate speed estimation algorithm (mean RMSE=0.35 m/s) does not require data from GPS or magnetometers rendering it valuable and usable in any environment (indoor or outdoor). The remaining studies advance the use of IMU arrays to estimate joint reactions in multibody systems. The fourth study establishes the accuracy of this method using experiments on an instrumented double pendulum. Estimated reaction forces and moments remain within 5.0\% and 5.9\% RMS respectively of values measured via load cells. The final study addresses the companion need to measure the location of joint centers. A method employing a single IMU yields the center of rotation (CoR) of a spherical joint to within 3 mm as established by a coordinate measuring machine. The simplicity and accuracy of this method may render it attractive for broad use in field, laboratory or clinical applications requiring non-invasive, rapid estimates of joint CoR.},

  abstract = {Each year thousands of individuals require surgical removal of the larynx (voice box) due to trauma or disease, and thereby require an alternative voice source or assistive device to verbally communicate. Although natural voice is lost after laryngectomy, most muscles controlling speech articulation remain intact. Surface electromyographic (sEMG) activity of speech musculature can be recorded from the neck and face, and used for automatic speech recognition to provide speech-to-text or synthesized speech as an alternative means of communication. This is true even when speech is mouthed or spoken in a silent (subvocal) manner, making it an appropriate communication platform after laryngectomy. In this study, eight individuals at least 6 months after total laryngectomy were recorded using eight sEMG sensors on their face (4) and neck (4) while reading phrases constructed from a 2500-word vocabulary. A unique set of phrases were used for training phoneme-based recognition models for each of the 39 commonly used phonemes in English, and the remaining phrases were used for testing word recognition of the models based on phoneme identification from running speech. Word error rates were on average 10.3\% for the full eight-sensor set (averaging 9.5\% for the top four participants), and 13.6\% when reducing the sensor set to four locations per individual (n = 7). This study provides a compelling proof-of-concept for sEMG-based alaryngeal speech recognition, with the strong potential to further improve recognition performance.},

Results: Net (above resting) CW, determined by indirect calorimetry was 31\% higher (average across speeds) in OLD (P {$<$} 0.05). The integrity of the passive pendulum like interchange of mechanical energies of the centre of mass (COMB), an energy-saving mechanism, was maintained in OLD. Furthermore, total mechanical work, determined from fluctuations in mechanical energy of COMB and of body segments relative to COMB, was not significantly elevated in OLD. This resulted in a lower efficiency in OLD (-17\%, P {$<$} 0.05). Co-activation, temporally quantified from electromyography recordings, was 31\% higher in OLD for antagonist muscles of the thigh (P {$<$} 0.05). Thigh co-activation was moderately correlated with CW at three speeds (r = 0.38--0.52, P {$<$} 0.05). Conclusion: Healthy septuagenarians with no gait impairment have an elevated CW which is not explained by an elevation in whole body mechanical work. Increased antagonist muscle co-activation (possibly an adaptation to ensure adequate joint stability) may offer partial explanation of the elevated CW.},

Design: Descriptive correlational. Setting: Home and community. Participants: Twenty-eight men and 22 women (Nϭ50) over the age 45 years with more than 6 months of hemiparetic gait after ischemic stroke. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Ambulatory activity (total daily step activity), mobility deficit severity (Berg Balance Scale [BBS] scores, timed 10-m walks), and cardiovascular fitness (energy costs of hemiparetic gait, peak exercise capacity [VO2peak]). Results: Mean ambulatory activity profiles were extremely low (2837 steps/d vs reported 5000 -- 6000 steps/d in sedentary older adults). Ambulatory activity levels were strongly associated with BBS scores (rϭ.581, PϽ.001) and self-selected floor walking velocity (rϭ.554, PϽ.001). Participants also had profound cardiovascular 11.7Ϯ2.8mL{$\cdot$}kgϪ1{$\cdot$}minϪ1). deconditioning (mean VO2peak, The energy costs of hemiparetic gait were high (8.7Ϯ1.7mL{$\cdot$}kgϪ1{$\cdot$}minϪ1), representing 76\% of physiologic fitness reserve. Although the relationships of economy of gait and VO2peak to ambulatory activity was not statistically significant, both the VO2peak and the physiologic fitness reserve, as expressed by fractional utilization, were strongly related to balance (rϭ.374, Pϭ.02; rϭϪ.430, PϽ .01, respectively.) The BBS predicted 30\% of the variance in ambulatory activity. Conclusions: Ambulatory activity levels and cardiovascular fitness in patients with chronic stroke are extremely low. Mobility deficits, particularly in balance, are associated with low ambulatory activity. Balance-related inactivity may be an important factor in deconditioning. Further studies are needed to better understand whether task-oriented exercise enhances balance and whether increases in daily ambulatory activity yield improved cardiovascular fitness in chronic stroke survivors.},

Various methods have been proposed for detecting initial contact (IC) and toe-off (TO) using IMUs affixed at various anatomical locations. However, the accuracy of such methods has yet to be compared. This study evaluated the accuracy of three common methods used for detecting gait events during jogging and running: (1) S-method, in which IC is identified as the instant of peak foot-resultant acceleration and TO is identified when the acceleration exceeds a threshold of 2g in the region of interest; (2) M-method, in which IC and TO are defined as the minimum before the positive peak shank vertical acceleration and the minimum in the region of interest, respectively; and (3) L-method, in which IC is indicated by the instant of peak pelvis anteroposterior acceleration and TO is identified by the maximum in the region of interest. The performance of the IMU-based methods in detecting IC and TO and estimating stance time (ST) were tested on 11 participants at jogging and running speeds against a reference provided by a force-platform method. The S-method was the most accurate for IC detection (overall mean absolute difference (MAD): 4.7 {\textpm} 4.1 ms). The M-method was the most accurate for TO detection (overall MAD: 7.0 {\textpm} 3.5 ms). A combination of M- and S-methods, called the MS-method, was the most accurate for ST estimation (overall MAD: 9.0 {\textpm} 3.9 ms). Thus, the MS-method is recommended for ST estimation; however, this method requires four IMUs for bilateral estimation.},

  abstract = {Background: Ankle exoskeletons can now reduce the metabolic cost of walking in humans without leg disability, but the biomechanical mechanisms that underlie this augmentation are not fully understood. In this study, we analyze the energetics and lower limb mechanics of human study participants walking with and without an active autonomous ankle exoskeleton previously shown to reduce the metabolic cost of walking. Methods: We measured the metabolic, kinetic and kinematic effects of wearing a battery powered bilateral ankle exoskeleton. Six participants walked on a level treadmill at 1.4 m/s under three conditions: exoskeleton not worn, exoskeleton worn in a powered-on state, and exoskeleton worn in a powered-off state. Metabolic rates were measured with a portable pulmonary gas exchange unit, body marker positions with a motion capture system, and ground reaction forces with a force-plate instrumented treadmill. Inverse dynamics were then used to estimate ankle, knee and hip torques and mechanical powers. Results: The active ankle exoskeleton provided a mean positive power of 0.105 {\textpm} 0.008 W/kg per leg during the push-off region of stance phase. The net metabolic cost of walking with the active exoskeleton (3.28 {\textpm} 0.10 W/kg) was an 11 {\textpm} 4 \% (p = 0.019) reduction compared to the cost of walking without the exoskeleton (3.71 {\textpm} 0.14 W/kg). Wearing the ankle exoskeleton significantly reduced the mean positive power of the ankle joint by 0.033 {\textpm} 0.006 W/kg (p = 0.007), the knee joint by 0.042 {\textpm} 0.015 W/kg (p = 0.020), and the hip joint by 0.034 {\textpm} 0.009 W/kg (p = 0.006). Conclusions: This study shows that the ankle exoskeleton does not exclusively reduce positive mechanical power at the ankle joint, but also mitigates positive power at the knee and hip. Furthermore, the active ankle exoskeleton did not simply replace biological ankle function in walking, but rather augmented the total (biological + exoskeletal) ankle moment and power. This study underscores the need for comprehensive models of human-exoskeleton interaction and global optimization methods for the discovery of new control strategies that optimize the physiological impact of leg exoskeletons.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose---Individuals with chronic stroke often demonstrate a ``plateau,'' or deceleration of motor recovery, which may lead to discharge from physical therapy (PT). However, numerous studies report improvements in motor function when individuals are provided intensive practice of motor tasks. We suggest that reduced task-specific walking practice during clinical PT contributes to limited gains in ambulatory function in those with a perceived plateau poststroke, and suggest that further gains can be realized if intensive stepping, or locomotor training (LT) is provided after discharge. Methods---Twenty subjects with chronic stroke completed a repeated baseline measures, randomized crossover trial in which walking performance was assessed during the last 4 weeks of clinical PT before discharge secondary to reaching a plateau, followed by 4 weeks of intensive LT and 4 weeks of no intervention. Outcome measures included clinical and physiological (metabolic) measures of walking overground and on a treadmill, and measures of daily stepping activity in the home and community, including during clinical PT and subsequent LT sessions. Results---Stepping practice was more than 4-fold higher during LT versus clinical PT sessions, with significant improvements in daily stepping and gait efficiency only after LT. Changes in daily stepping after clinical PT and intensive LT were correlated (PϽ0.001) with the amount of stepping practice received during these interventions. Conclusions---Intensive LT results in improved daily stepping in individuals poststroke who have been discharged from PT because of a perceived plateau in motor function. These improvements may be related to the amount and intensity of stepping practice. (Stroke. 2010;41:129-135.)},

  abstract = {Background: Application of objective measurement of stroke gait with accelerometer-based wearable technology and associated algorithms is increasing, despite reports questioning the accuracy of this technique in quantifying specific stroke-related gait impairments. The aim of this study is to determine the feasibility, validity and reliability of a low-cost open-source system incorporating algorithms and a single tri-axial accelerometer-based wearable to quantify gait characteristics in the laboratory and community post-stroke. Methods: Twenty-five participants with stroke wore the wearable (AX3, Axivity) on the lower back during a laboratory 2 minute continuous walk (preferred pace) on two occasions a week apart and continuously in the community for two consecutive 7 day periods. Video, instrumented walkway (GaitRite) and an OPAL accelerometer-based wearable were used as laboratory references. Results: Feasibility of the proposed system was good. The system was valid for measuring step count (ICC 0.899). Inherent differences in gait quantification between algorithm and GaitRite resulted in difficulties comparing agreement between the different systems. Agreement was moderate-excellent (ICC 0.503--0.936) for mean and variability gait characteristics vs. OPAL. Agreement was moderate-poor between the system and OPAL for asymmetry characteristics. Moderateexcellent reliability (ICC 0.534--0.857) was demonstrated for 11/14 laboratory measured gait characteristics. Community test-retest reliability was good-excellent (ICC 0.867--0.983) for all except one (ICC 0.699) of the 19 gait characteristics. Conclusion: The proposed system is a low-cost, reliable tool for quantifying gait post-stroke with multiple potential applications. Further refinement to optimise gait quantification algorithms for certain gait characteristics including gait asymmetry is required.},

Twenty-six patients suffering knee hyperextension resulting from cerebrovascular disorders were allocated to either a control group or an experimental group. Both groups received treatment for knee hyperextension during two consecutive phases. During phase I the control group received physical therapy and the experimental group received electrogoniometric feedback as an adjunct to physical therapy. In phase II both groups received physical therapy alone. Each phase lasted four weeks, during which time patients were treated 45 minutes daily, five days every week. Subjects in the experimental group showed greater reduction in knee hyperextension. This was particularly evident in phase II when the difference between groups for reduction in knee hyperextension reached statistical significance (U = 40, p = 0.011). These results suggest that the addition of electrogoniometric feedback to standard physical therapy enhanced the effectiveness of treatment for genu recurvatum in stroke.},

Progress in new technologies has led the development of a series of devices and techniques which allow for objective evaluation, making measurements more efficient and effective and providing specialists with reliable information. Firstly, an introduction of the key gait parameters and semi-subjective methods is presented. Secondly, technologies and studies on the different objective methods are reviewed. Finally, based on the latest research, the characteristics of each method are discussed. 40\% of the reviewed articles published in late 2012 and 2013 were related to non-wearable systems, 37.5\% presented inertial sensor-based systems, and the remaining 22.5\% corresponded to other wearable systems. An increasing number of research works demonstrate that various parameters such as precision, conformability, usability or transportability have indicated that the portable systems based on body sensors are promising methods for gait analysis.},

  abstract = {Objective: To determine, using the Muscular Utilization Ratio (MUR) method, whether plantarflexor weakness is among the factors preventing stroke subjects from walking at faster speeds.Potential compensations by the hip flexors were also examined. Design: A convenience sample of 17 chronic stroke subjects in a context of a descriptive study. Background: Gait speed is correlated with the residual strength of the muscles involved in gait in stroke subjects. However, it has not been established if this residual strength limits gait speed. Methods: Kinetic and kinematic data for comfortable and maximal gait speeds were collected on the paretic side, and were used to determine the moments in plantarflexion (mechanical demand; MUR numerator) during the push-off phase. The maximal potential rnoment (MUR denominator) of the plantarflexors during gait was predicted using an equation derived from dynamometric data collected with a Biodex system. The MURs of the plantarflexors were then calculated at every 1\% interval of the push-off phase. The pull-off phase of gait and the hip flexor strength were also examined. Results: Ten subjects of the sample had a MUR value between 80 and 150\% at maximal gait speed. These subjects produced the lowest peak torques in plantarflexion. Each of the four fastest subjects of this group had a large hip flexion moment during the pull-off phase of gait and produced high hip flexion torque values on the dynamometer. Each of the seven remaining subjects had a MUR value under 70\% when they walked at maximal speed. Conclusions: Weakness of the plantarflexors should be considered as one factor limiting gait speed in 10 hemiparetic subjects. Some subjects with weak plantarflexors could walk rapidly because they compensated with the hip flexors. For the remaining stroke subjects, factors other than weakness of the plantarflexors have to be considered in order to explain the reduction in their gait speed.},

  abstract = {Magnetic and Inertial measurement units (MIMUs) have become exceedingly popular for ambulatory human motion analysis during the past two decades. However, measuring anatomically meaningful segment and joint kinematics requires virtual alignment of the MIMU frame with the anatomical frame of its corresponding segment. Therefore, this paper presents a simple calibration procedure, based on MIMU readouts, to align the inertial frame of the MIMU with the anatomical frames, as recommended by ISB. The proposed calibration includes five seconds of quiet standing in a neutral posture followed by ten consecutive hip flexions/extensions. This procedure will independently calibrate MIMUs attached to the pelvis, thigh, shank, and foot. The accuracy and repeatability of the calibration procedure and the 3D joint angle estimation were validated against the gold standard motion capture system by an experimental study with ten able-bodied participants. The procedure showed high test-retest repeatability in aligning the MIMU frame with its corresponding anatomical frame, i.e., the helical angle between the MIMU and anatomical frames did not significantly differ between the test and retest sessions (except for thigh MIMU). Compared to previously introduced procedures, this procedure attained the highest interparticipant repeatability (inter-participant coefficient of variations of the helical angle: 20.5--42.2\%). Further, the proposed calibration would reduce the offset errors of the 3D joint angle estimation (up to 12.8 degrees on average) compared to joint angle estimation without calibration (up to 26.3 degrees on average). The proposed calibration enables MIMU to measure clinically meaningful gait kinematics.},

  abstract = {Walking is a motor task requiring coordination of many muscles. Previous biomechanical studies, based primarily on analyses of the net ankle moment during stance, have concluded different functional roles for the plantar flexors. We hypothesize that some of the disparities in interpretation arise because of the effects of the uniarticular and biarticular muscles that comprise the plantar flexor group have not been separated. Furthermore, we believe that an accurate determination of muscle function requires quantification of the contributions of individual plantar flexor muscles to the energetics of individual body segments. In this study, we examined the individual contributions of the ankle plantar flexors (gastrocnemius (GAS); soleus (SOL)) to the body segment energetics using a musculoskeletal model and optimization framework to generate a forward dynamics simulation of normal walking at 1.5 m/s. At any instant in the gait cycle, the contribution of a muscle to support and forward progression was defined by its contribution to trunk vertical and horizontal acceleration, respectively, and its contribution to swing initiation by the mechanical energy it delivers to the leg in pre-swing (i.e., double-leg stance prior to toe-off). GAS and SOL were both found to provide trunk support during single-leg stance and pre-swing. In early single-leg stance, undergoing eccentric and isometric activity, they accelerate the trunk vertically but decelerate forward trunk progression. In mid single-leg stance, while isometric, GAS delivers energy to the leg while SOL decelerates it, and SOL delivers energy to the trunk while GAS decelerates it. In late single-leg stance through pre-swing, though GAS and SOL both undergo concentric activity and accelerate the trunk forward while decelerating the downward motion of the trunk (i.e., providing forward progression and support), they execute different energetic functions. The energy produced from SOL accelerates the trunk forward, whereas GAS delivers almost all its energy to accelerate the leg to initiate swing. Although GAS and SOL maintain or accelerate forward motion in mid single-leg stance through pre-swing, other muscles acting at the beginning of stance contribute comparably to forward progression. In summary, throughout single-leg stance both SOL and GAS provide vertical support, in mid single-leg stance SOL and GAS have opposite energetic effects on the leg and trunk to ensure support and forward progression of both the leg and trunk, and in pre-swing only GAS contributes to swing initiation. r 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {Inverted pendulum models of walking predict that little muscle work is required for the exchange of body potential and kinetic energy in single-limb support. External power during walking (product of the measured ground reaction force and body center-ofmass (COM) velocity) is often analyzed to deduce net work output or mechanical energetic cost by muscles. Based on external power analyses and inverted pendulum theory, it has been suggested that a primary mechanical energetic cost may be associated with the mechanical work required to redirect the COM motion at the step-to-step transition. However, these models do not capture the multi-muscle, multi-segmental properties of walking, co-excitation of muscles to coordinate segmental energetic flow, and simultaneous production of positive and negative muscle work. In this study, a muscle-actuated forward dynamic simulation of walking was used to assess whether: (1) potential and kinetic energy of the body are exchanged with little muscle work; (2) external mechanical power can estimate the mechanical energetic cost for muscles; and (3) the net work output and the mechanical energetic cost for muscles occurs mostly in double support. We found that the net work output by muscles cannot be estimated from external power and was the highest when the COM moved upward in early single-limb support even though kinetic and potential energy were exchanged, and muscle mechanical (and most likely metabolic) energetic cost is dominated not only by the need to redirect the COM in double support but also by the need to raise the COM in single support.},

Body joint angles, joint angular velocities, ground reaction force and center of plantar pressure of each foot are obtained from these sensors and input into supervised machine learning algorithms. The proposed initiation detection method recognizes two events: gait onset (an anticipatory movement preceding foot lifting) and toe-off. The termination detection algorithm segments gait into steps, measures the signals over a buffer at the beginning of each step, and determines whether this measurement belongs to the final step. The approach is validated with 10 subjects at two gait speeds, using within-subject and subject-independent cross-validation. Results show that gait initiation can be detected timely and accurately, with few errors in the case of within-subject cross-validation and overall good performance in subject-independent cross-validation. Gait termination can be predicted in over 80\% of trials well before the subject comes to a complete stop. Results also show that the two sensor types are equivalent in predicting gait initiation while inertial measurement units are generally superior in predicting gait termination. Potential use of the algorithms is foreseen primarily with assistive devices such as prostheses and exoskeletons. {\copyright} 2013 IPEM.},

  abstract = {The timing of heel strike (HS) and toe off (TO), the events that mark the transitions between stance and swing phase of gait, is essential when analysing gait. Force plate recordings are routinely used to identify these events. Additional instrumentation, such as force sensitive resistors, can also been used. These approaches, however, include restrictions on the number of steps that can be analyzed and further encumbrance of the subject. We developed an algorithm which automatically determines these times from kinematic data recorded by a motion capture system, which is routinely used in gait analysis laboratories. The foot velocity algorithm (FVA) uses data from the heel and toe markers and identifies features in the vertical velocity of the foot which correspond to the gait events. We verified the performance of the FVA using a large data set of 54 normal children that contained both force plate recordings and kinematic data and found errors of (mean {\AE} standard deviation) 16 {\AE} 15 ms for HS and 9 {\AE} 15 ms for TO. The algorithm also worked well when tested on a small number of children with spastic diplegia. We compared the performance of the FVA with another kinematic method previously described. Our foot velocity algorithm offered more accurate results and was easier to implement than the previously described one, and should be applicable in a variety of gait analysis settings.},

Accurate quantification of deadlift biomechanics is important to reduce the risk of injury and ensure training and rehabilitation goals are achieved. This study sought to develop and evaluate deadlift exercise technique classification systems utilising Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), recording at 51.2~Hz, worn on the lumbar spine, both thighs and both shanks. It also sought to compare classification quality when these IMUs are worn in combination and in isolation. Two datasets of IMU deadlift data were collected. Eighty participants first completed deadlifts with acceptable technique and 5 distinct, deliberately induced deviations from acceptable form. Fifty-five members of this group also completed a fatiguing protocol (3-Repition Maximum test) to enable the collection of natural deadlift deviations. For both datasets, universal and personalised random-forests classifiers were developed and evaluated. Personalised classifiers outperformed universal classifiers in accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in the binary classification of acceptable or aberrant technique and in the multi-label classification of specific deadlift deviations. Whilst recent research has favoured universal classifiers due to the reduced overhead in setting them up for new system users, this work demonstrates that such techniques may not be appropriate for classifying deadlift technique due to the poor accuracy achieved. However, personalised classifiers perform very well in assessing deadlift technique, even when using data derived from a single lumbar-worn IMU to detect specific naturally occurring technique mistakes.},

Two skill groups practised on three routes per session over four separate sessions. At the end of the final session, climbers undertook a transfer test. Routes, matched for difficulty, were manipulated in terms of hand-hold design. Route-1 and Route-2 were designed with holds with a single graspable edge, aligned entirely parallel or perpendicular to the ground plane respectively. Route-3 had at each hold, two graspable edges (one parallel and one perpendicular to the ground plane). Behavioral exploration at the hip and hands were largest under the metastable condition (Route-3). Skill level also interacted with route properties during practice and influenced transfer. Data suggest metastability induces exploratory behaviors. Less skilled individuals explore both hand and hip levels, whereas, more experienced climbers explore at the hip level.},

Recently, the application of principal component analysis (PCA) to gait data has shown promise in detecting important biomechanical features. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to define a new foot strike detection method for a continuum of striking techniques, by applying PCA to joint angle waveforms. In accordance with Newtonian mechanics, it was hypothesized that transient features in the sagittal-plane accelerations of the lower extremity would be linked with the impulsive application of force to the foot at foot strike. Kinematic and kinetic data from treadmill running were selected for 154 subjects, from a database of gait biomechanics. Ankle, knee and hip sagittal plane angular acceleration kinematic curves were chained together to form a row input to a PCA matrix. A linear polynomial was calculated based on PCA scores, and a 10-fold cross-validation was performed to evaluate prediction accuracy against gold-standard foot strike as determined by a 10. N rise in the vertical ground reaction force. Results show 89-94\% of all predicted foot strikes were within 4 frames (20. ms) of the gold standard with the largest error being 28. ms. It is concluded that this new foot strike detection is an improvement on existing methods and can be applied regardless of whether the runner exhibits a rearfoot, midfoot, or forefoot strike pattern. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Background: The quantification of gait temporal parameters (i.e. step time, stance time) is crucial in human motion analysis and requires the accurate identification of gait events (i.e. heel strike, toe off). With the widespread use of inertial wearable sensors, many algorithms were proposed and applied for the purpose. Nevertheless, only few studies addressed the assessment of the actual performance of these algorithms, rather considering each proposed algorithm as a whole. Research question: How different implementation characteristics influence the assessment of gait events and temporal parameters from inertial sensor measures in terms of accuracy and repeatability? Methods: Seventeen different algorithms were identified from a systematic review and classified based on: 1) sensor position, 2) target variable, 3) computational approach. The influence of these characteristics was analysed on walking data of 35 healthy volunteers mounting 5 tri-axial inertial sensors. Foot contact events identified by 2 force platforms were assumed as gold standard. Temporal parameters were calculated from gait events. Algorithm performance was analysed in terms of accuracy (error median value) and repeatability (error 25th and 75th percentile values). Results: Shank- and foot-based algorithms performed better (in terms of accuracy and repeatability) in gait events detection and stance time estimation than lower trunk-based ones, while sensor position did not affect step estimate, given the error bias characteristics. Angular velocity-based algorithms performed significantly better than acceleration-based ones for toe off detection in terms of repeatability (68 ms and 102 ms, 25th--75th percentile error range, respectively) and, for heel strike detection, showed better repeatability (40 ms and 111 ms) and comparable accuracy (65 ms and 60 ms median error, respectively) than acceleration-based ones. The performance of different computational approaches varied depending on sensor positioning. Significance: Present results support the selection of the proper algorithm for the estimation of gait events and temporal parameters in relation to the specific application.},

  abstract = {This article reviews the theoretical basis and methods for disability measure-ment. Different methods arise from different theoretical perspectives. Recent efforts to develop a general international disability measure consistent with the social model of disability aim to produce an internationally comparable measure of disability with which to assess the equalisation of opportunities. Such a measure cannot consistently identify disabled people in need of health and social services. Correctly identifying those in need of these services particularly concerns developing countries where government revenues and disability services are severely limited. This review highlights the need for multiple disability measures to meet different purposes of measurement. The Washington Group general measure on disability and Katz's Activities of Daily Living Index are recommended as valid measures of varying functioning level consistent with the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. The article draws the links between different models of disability and measurement methods. The social model of disability is important for defining general disability prevalence for the purpose of assessing equalisation of opportunities, but is unsuitable for identifying the proportion of the disabled population in need of health and social services. We advocate the use of multiple disability measures to meet different policy objectives: a general disability measure to monitor the level of functioning in a population and formulate disability-inclusive policies, and a measure of severe disability to identify persons with high service needs for the purpose of health and social policy design. Estimation of severe disability is pertinent in developing countries where disability services and public resources are severely limited.},

Rehabilitation strategies that promote corticomotor balance might improve poststroke walking mechanics and enhance functional ambulation. Objective.{\enspace}The study objectives were to test the effectiveness of a single session of gait training using functional electrical stimulation (FES) to improve plantarflexor corticomotor symmetry and plantarflexion ankle moment symmetry and to determine whether changes in corticomotor symmetry were related to changes in ankle moment symmetry within the session.

Methods.{\enspace}On separate days, 20 people with chronic stroke completed a session of treadmill walking either with or without the use of FES of their ankle dorsi- and plantarflexor muscles. We calculated plantarflexor corticomotor symmetry using transcranial magnetic stimulation and plantarflexion ankle moment symmetry during walking between the paretic and the nonparetic limbs before and after each session. We compared changes and tested relationships between corticomotor symmetry and ankle moment symmetry following each session. Results.{\enspace}Following the session with FES, there was an increase in plantarflexor corticomotor s\-ymmetry that was related to the observed increase in ankle moment symmetry. In contrast, following the session without FES, there were no changes in corticomotor symmetry or ankle moment symmetry. Limitations.{\enspace} No stratification was made on the basis of lesion size, location, or clinical severity. Conclusions.{\enspace}These findings demonstrate, for the first time (to our knowledge), the ability of a single session of gait training with FES to induce positive corticomotor plasticity in people in the chronic stage of stroke recovery. They also provide insight into the neurophysiologic mechanisms underlying improvements in biomechanical walking function.},

  abstract = {Accelerometer technology is becoming increasingly smaller and cheaper to develop. As a result such devices can easily be integrated into a shoe to ubiquitously capture gait information which could potentially be used to detect development of injuries, neuro-degenerative diseases or a change in disease symptoms. Much research has been done in the past comparing accelerometer data to kinematic or spatio-temporal data; however little has been done investigating what insights into normal and dysfunctional movement patterns accelerometer data from the foot can provide. It is important to first gain an understanding of how foot accelerometer data behaves during healthy gait before developing methods to assess dysfunctional gait with such a tool. In this preliminary study we have analyzed data harnessed from tri-axial accelerometers mounted on the dorsi of the feet in 6 healthy subjects walking at different speeds (slow, normal relaxed walking, fast) to hypothesize what insights into movement and motor control accelerometer data output alone can provide. Results indicate that peak acceleration during initial swing, mean acceleration during mid-swing and peak acceleration at initial contact are main quantitative features that distinguish between walking velocities. These results suggest that quantifying specific acceleration patterns during gait may one day be useful to cheaply and easily detect gait pattern changes due to disease or injury. Though these preliminary results are promising, further work is required to investigate the utility of accelerometer use in a patient population.},

Design: Repeated-measures, within-subject design. Setting: Research laboratory. Participants: A total of 9 individuals with chronic hemiparesis poststroke and 7 unimpaired similarly aged controls (NZ16). Intervention: Individuals walked on a treadmill in 2 separate studies. First, we compared the metabolic COW with an anterior force applied to the COM that (1) coincided with paretic propulsion or (2) was applied throughout the gait cycle. Next, we compared the metabolic COW with anterior (assistive) or posterior (resistive) forces applied during paretic propulsion. Main Outcome Measure: Metabolic COW. Results: The COW was significantly greater in the Stroke group. Anterior (propulsive) assistance reduced the COW differently based on group. The Stroke group exhibited a 12\% reduction in COW when assistance was provided only during paretic propulsion, but not when assistance was provided throughout the gait cycle. In contrast, the Control group demonstrated reduced COW during both anterior assistance conditions. In addition, we observed that resistance during paretic propulsion (simulated hemiparesis for Control group) significantly increased the COW. Conclusions: Systematically manipulating propulsive forces at the body's COM had a profound influence on metabolic cost. The timing of propulsive forces to the COM is important and needs to coincide with paretic terminal stance. Additional internally or externally generated propulsive forces applied to the body's COM poststroke may produce a lower metabolic COW.},

  abstract = {Background: Technology-mediated neurorehabilitation is suggested to enhance training intensity and therefore functional gains. Here, we used a novel virtual reality (VR) system for task-specific upper extremity training after stroke. The system offers interactive exercises integrating motor priming techniques and embodied visuomotor feedback. In this pilot study, we examined (i) rehabilitation dose and training intensity, (ii) functional improvements, and (iii) safety and tolerance when exposed to intensive VR rehabilitation. Methods: Ten outpatient stroke survivors with chronic ({$>$}6 months) upper extremity paresis participated in a tensession VR-based upper limb rehabilitation program (2 sessions/week). Results: All participants completed all sessions of the treatment. In total, they received a median of 403 min of upper limb therapy, with 290 min of effective training. Within that time, participants performed a median of 4713 goal-directed movements. Importantly, training intensity increased progressively across sessions from 13.2 to 17.3 movements per minute. Clinical measures show that despite being in the chronic phase, where recovery potential is thought to be limited, participants showed a median improvement rate of 5.3\% in motor function (Fugl-Meyer Assessment for Upper Extremity; FMA-UE) post intervention compared to baseline, and of 15.4\% at one-month follow-up. For three of them, this improvement was clinically significant. A significant improvement in shoulder active range of motion (AROM) was also observed at follow-up. Participants reported very low levels of pain, stress and fatigue following each session of training, indicating that the intensive VR intervention was well tolerated. No severe adverse events were reported. All participants expressed their interest in continuing the intervention at the hospital or even at home, suggesting high levels of adherence and motivation for the provided intervention. Conclusions: This pilot study showed how a dedicated VR system could deliver high rehabilitation doses and, importantly, intensive training in chronic stroke survivors. FMA-UE and AROM results suggest that task-specific VR training may be beneficial for further functional recovery both in the chronic stage of stroke. Longitudinal studies with higher doses and sample sizes are required to confirm the therapy effectiveness. Trial registration: This trial was retrospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov database (registration number NCT03094650) on 14 March 2017.},

In human movement applications, the drift inherent to the accelerometer signals is often reduced by exploiting the cyclical nature of gait and under the hypothesis that the velocity of the sensor is zero at some point in stance. In this study, the validity of the latter hypothesis was investigated by determining the minimum velocity of progression of selected points of the foot and shank during the stance phase of the gait cycle while walking at three different speeds on level ground. The errors affecting the accuracy of the stride length estimation resulting from assuming a zero velocity at the beginning of the integration interval were evaluated on twenty healthy subjects. Results showed that the minimum velocity of the selected points on the foot and shank increased as gait speed increased. Whereas the average minimum velocity of the foot locations was lower than 0.011 m/s, the velocity of the shank locations were up to 0.049 m/s corresponding to a percent error of the stride length equal to 3.3\%. The preferable foot locations for an inertial sensor resulted to be the calcaneus and the lateral aspect of the rearfoot. In estimating the stride length, the hypothesis that the velocity of the sensor can be set to zero sometimes during stance is acceptable only if the sensor is attached to the foot.},

When the knee is extended, the posterolateral bundle (PL) is tight and the anteromedial (AM) bundle is moderately lax. As the knee is flexed, the femoral attachment of the ACL becomes a more horizontal orientation; causing the AM bundle to tighten and the PL bundle to relax. There is some degree of variability for the femoral origin of the anterome-dial and posterolateral bundle. The anteromedial bundle is located proximal and anterior in the femoral ACL origin (high and deep in the notch when the knee is flexed at 90 degrees ); the posterolateral bundle starts in the distal and posterior aspect of the femoral ACL origin (shallow and low when the knee is flexed at 90 degrees ). In the frontal plane the anteromedial bundle origin is in the 10:30 clock position and the postero-lateral bundle origin in the 9:30 clock position. At the tibial insertion the ACL fans out to form the foot region. The anteromedial bundle insertion is in the anterior part of the tibial ACL footprint, the posterolateral bundle in the posterior part. While the anteromedial bundle is the primary restraint against anterior tibial translation, the posterolateral bundle tends to stabilize the knee near full extension, particularly against rotatory loads.},

  abstract = {Clinical studies of hemiparetic walking have shown pre-swing abnormalities in the paretic leg suggesting that paretic muscle contributions to important biomechanical walking subtasks are different than those of non-disabled individuals. Three-dimensional forward dynamics simulations of two representative hemiparetic subjects with different levels of walking function classified by self-selected walking speed (i.e., limited community {$\frac{1}{4}$} 0.4--0.8 m/s and community walkers {$\frac{1}{4}$} 4 0.8 m/s) and a speedmatched control were generated to quantify individual muscle contributions to forward propulsion, swing initiation and power generation during the pre-swing phase (i.e., double support phase proceeding toe-off). Simulation analyses identified decreased paretic soleus and gastrocnemius contributions to forward propulsion and power generation as the primary impairment in the limited community walker compared to the control subject. The non-paretic leg did not compensate for decreased forward propulsion by paretic muscles during pre-swing in the limited community walker. Paretic muscles had the net effect to absorb energy from the paretic leg during pre-swing in the community walker suggesting that deficits in swing initiation are a primary impairment. Specifically, the paretic gastrocnemius and hip flexors (i.e., iliacus, psoas and sartorius) contributed less to swing initiation and the paretic soleus and gluteus medius absorbed more power from the paretic leg in the community walker compared to the control subject. Rehabilitation strategies aimed at diminishing these deficits have much potential to improve walking function in these hemiparetic subjects and those with similar deficits.},

Three-dimensional (3D) motion capture systems are widely used, accurate systems, but are costly and not available in many clinical settings.

The purpose of this study was to assess concurrent validity of the Kinect with Brekel Kinect software in comparison to Vicon Nexus during sagittal plane gait kinematics. Twenty healthy adults (nine male, 11 female) were tracked while walking and jogging at three velocities on a treadmill. Concurrent hip and knee peak flexion and extension and stride timing measurements were compared between Vicon and Kinect. Although Kinect measurements were representative of normal gait, the Kinect generally under-estimated joint flexion and over-estimated extension. Kinect and Vicon hip angular displacement correlation was very low and error was large. Kinect knee measurements were somewhat better than hip, but were not consistent enough for clinical assessment. Correlation between Kinect and Vicon stride timing was high and error was fairly small. Variability in Kinect measurements was smallest at the slowest velocity. The Kinect has basic motion capture capabilities and with some minor adjustments will be an acceptable tool to measure stride timing, but sophisticated advances in software and hardware are necessary to improve Kinect sensitivity before it can be implemented for clinical use.},

  abstract = {Aging and many pathologies that affect gait are associated with reduced ankle power output and thus trailing limb propulsion during walking. However, quantifying trailing limb propulsion requires sophisticated measurement equipment at significant expense that fundamentally limits clinical translation for diagnostics or gait rehabilitation. As a component of joint power, our purpose was to determine if shank acceleration estimated via accelerometers during push-off can serve as a clinically feasible surrogate for ankle power output and peak anterior ground reaction forces (GRF) during walking. As hypothesized, we found that young adults modulated walking speed via changes in peak anterior GRF and peak ankle power output that correlated with proportional changes in shank acceleration during push-off, both at the individual subject (R2   0.80, p {$<$} 0.01) and group average (R2   0.74, p {$<$} 0.01) levels. In addition, we found that unilateral deficits in trailing limb propulsion induced via a leg bracing elicited unilateral and relatively proportional reductions in peak anterior GRF, peak ankle power, and peak shank acceleration. These unilateral leg bracing effects on peak shank acceleration correlated with those in peak ankle power (braced leg: R2 = 0.43, p = 0.028) but those effects in both peak shank acceleration and peak ankle power were disassociated from those in peak anterior GRF. In conclusion, our findings in young adults provide an early benchmark for the development of affordable and clinically feasible alternatives for assessing and monitoring trailing limb propulsion during walking.},

Objective: To determine if Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) reach distance was associated with risk of lower extremity injury among high school basketball players. Background: Although balance has been proposed as a risk factor for sports-related injury, few researchers have used a dynamic balance test to examine this relationship. Methods and Measures: Prior to the 2004 basketball season, the anterior, posteromedial, and posterolateral SEBT reach distances and limb lengths of 235 high school basketball players were measured bilaterally. The Athletic Health Care System Daily Injury Report was used to document time loss injuries. After normalizing for lower limb length, each reach distance, right/left reach distance difference, and composite reach distance were examined using odds ratio and logistic regression analyses. Results: The reliability of the SEBT components ranged from 0.82 to 0.87 (ICC3,1) and was 0.99 for the measurement of limb length. Logistic regression models indicated that players with an anterior right/left reach distance difference greater than 4 cm were 2.5 times more likely to sustain a lower extremity injury (P {$<$}.05). Girls with a composite reach distance less than 94.0\% of their limb length were 6.5 times more likely to have a lower extremity injury (P {$<$}.05). Conclusions: We found components of the SEBT to be reliable and predictive measures of lower extremity injury in high school basketball players. Our results suggest that the SEBT can be incorporated into preparticipation physical examinations to identify basketball players who are at increased risk for injury.},

Seventy-two adults poststroke completed the 6-minute walk as part of baseline testing for a randomized intervention clinical trial. Pulse and blood pressure were taken before and after the walk. Subjects walked an average of 216 m in 6 minutes. The Fugl-Meyer lower-limb motor score and the Berg Balance score explained 45 percent of the variance in distance walked.

However, studies using these systems are restricted to laboratory settings for technical reasons, which may lead to findings that are not representative of real-life context. Recently developed commercial and home-made inertial measurement sensors (M/IMU) are potentially good alternatives to the laboratory-based systems, and recent technology improvements required a synthesis of the current evidence. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the criterion validity and reliability of M/IMU for each body joint and for tasks of different levels of complexity. Five different databases were screened (Pubmed, Cinhal, Embase, Ergonomic abstract, and Compendex). Two evaluators performed independent selection, quality assessment (consensus-based standards for the selection of health measurement instruments [COSMIN] and quality appraisal tools), and data extraction. Forty-two studies were included. Reported validity varied according to task complexity (higher validity for simple tasks) and the joint evaluated (better validity for lower limb joints). More studies on reliability are needed to make stronger conclusions, as the number of studies addressing this psychometric property was limited. M/IMU should be considered as a valid tool to assess whole body range of motion, but further studies are needed to standardize technical procedures to obtain more accurate data.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are a number of different approaches to physiotherapy treatment following stroke. Central to these are approaches based on 'neurophysiological' principles, 'motor learning' principles and 'orthopaedic' principles. OBJECTIVES: To determine if there is a difference in the recovery of postural control and lower limb function in patients with stroke if physiotherapy treatment is based on orthopaedic or neurophysiological or motor learning principles, or on a mixture of these treatment principles. SEARCH STRATEGY: This review drew on the search strategy developed by the Stroke Group as a whole. Relevant trials were identified in the Stroke Group Trials Register of Controlled Trials which was last searched in May 2001. We also searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library, Issue 4 1999), MEDLINE (1966-1999), EMBASE (1980-1999) and CINAHL (1982-1999) and contacted experts and researchers with an interest in stroke. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies - randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials. Participants - adults with a clinical diagnosis of stroke. Interventions - physiotherapy treatment approaches aimed at promoting the recovery of postural control and lower limb function. Outcomes - measures of disability, motor impairment or participation. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent reviewers categorised the identified trials according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, documented the methodological quality and extracted the data. MAIN RESULTS: Eleven trials were included in the review, three of which were included in two comparisons. Four trials compared a neurophysiological approach with another approach; four trials compared a motor learning approach with another approach; four studies compared a mixed approach with another approach; two trials reported comparisons of sub-groups of the same approach. A large number of heterogeneous outcome measures were used, limiting the comparison of trial results. No one type of approach had a significantly better outcome than any other type of approach. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to conclude that any one physiotherapy treatment approach is more effective than another in promoting the recovery of postural control or lower limb function.

  abstract = {Referential behavior theory (RBT), a general dynamical approach to psychological and related systems that operate through a control or referencing process, is introduced. A review of existing evidence shows that this approach can apply to a variety of human and animal systems and tasks, whether the framing language is that of homeostasis, error correction, coupled biological oscillators, motor control, adaptive change, cognitive goal-setting, evaluation and refinement, or neural network learning. Thus, RBT provides a path for reconciliation of dynamical and information-processing accounts of action and cognition. RBT generates a class of mathematical equations, one of which, the discrete control equation (DCE), forms the basis for more detailed investigation. The primary focus here is on the application of the DCE to the temporal structure of regular human movement. Given certain conditions, the equation produces various standard (and new, more general) forms of the circle map class that governs relative phase in motor coordination and, hence, generates well-documented nonlinear "dynamical" motor phenomena such as behavioral attractors, phase transitions, critical slowing, and so on. Under certain other conditions, the DCE produces the linear stochastic timing models often associated with motor program traditions, accommodating hierarchical effects, open- and closed-loop conditions, and unilimb and multilimb movement. A number of new predictions are identified from the approach, and a review of experimental evidence gives support for the claim that the current formulation is an integrated generalization and improvement of several aspects of existing motor program and dynamic approaches.},

In this context, the aim of this study is to analyse the intra and inter test repeatability of several temporal and spectral indicators using an IMU under constant running conditions. Accelerations were measured using three IMU's mounted on the trunk near the lumbar, the right tibia and the dorsal surface of the right shoe above the metatarsals. The subject follows two different protocols to realize the intra test and the inter test repeatability of eight different parameters: root mean square (RMS) values of acceleration, kurtosis, total energy, median frequency, mechanical stiffness, mean stride duration, contact and flying duration. For all parameters the mean, standard deviation and coefficient of variation were computed for each set of test. The coefficient of variation was lower than 5\% for both test for all parameters except kurtosis and the median frequency. Parameters with acceptable value at constant conditions of surface and speed can be used as an indicator to compare several conditions, such as the influence of speed, surface or anthropometry of the subjects.},

  abstract = {Objective: Musculoskeletal models provide a noninvasive means to study human movement and predict the effects of interventions on gait. Our goal was to create an open-source 3-D musculoskeletal model with high-fidelity representations of the lower limb musculature of healthy young individuals that can be used to generate accurate simulations of gait. Methods: Our model includes bony geometry for the full body, 37 degrees of freedom to define joint kinematics, Hill-type models of 80 muscle-tendon units actuating the lower limbs, and 17 ideal torque actuators driving the upper body. The model's musculotendon parameters are derived from previous anatomical measurements of 21 cadaver specimens and magnetic resonance images of 24 young healthy subjects. We tested the model by evaluating its computational time and accuracy of simulations of healthy walking and running. Results: Generating muscle-driven simulations of normal walking and running took approximately 10 minutes on a typical desktop computer. The differences between our muscle-generated and inverse dynamics joint moments were within 3\% (RMSE) of the peak inverse dynamics joint moments in both walking and running, and our simulated muscle activity showed qualitative agreement with salient features from experimental electromyography data. Conclusion: These results suggest that our model is suitable for generating muscle-driven simulations of healthy gait. We encourage other researchers to further validate and apply the model to study other motions of the lower extremity. Significance: The model is implemented in the open-source software platform OpenSim. The model and data used to create and test the simulations are freely available at https://simtk.org/home/full\_body/, allowing others to reproduce these results and create their own simulations.},

It puts forth a convolutive Nonnegative Matrix Factorization algorithm with sparseness constraints (cNMFsc) to decompose a given data matrix into a set of spatiotemporal basis sequences and an activation matrix. The algorithm optimizes a cost function that trades off the mismatch between the proposed model and the input data against the number of primitives that are active at any given instant. The method is applied to both measured articulatory data obtained through electromagnetic articulography as well as synthetic data generated using an articulatory synthesizer. The paper then describes how to evaluate the algorithm performance quantitatively and further performs a qualitative assessment of the algorithm's ability to recover compositional structure from data. This is done using pseudo ground-truth primitives generated by the articulatory synthesizer based on an Articulatory Phonology frame-work [Browman and Goldstein (1995). "Dynamics and articulatory phonology," in Mind as motion: Explorations in the dynamics of cognition, edited by R. F. Port and T.van Gelder (MIT Press, Cambridge, MA), pp. 175-194]. The results suggest that the proposed algorithm extracts movement primitives from human speech production data that are linguistically interpretable. Such a framework might aid the understanding of longstanding issues in speech production such as motor control and coarticulation.},

The aims were 1) to determine the contribution of daily PA to the HRQL of individuals with chronic stroke and 2) to assess the relationship between the functional ability of these individuals to the amount of daily PA. Methods: The amount of daily PA of forty adults with chronic stroke (mean age 66.5 {\textpm} 9.6 years) was monitored using two measures. Accelerometers (Actical) were worn on the hip for three consecutive days in conjunction with a self-report questionnaire [the PA Scale for Individuals with Physical Disabilities (PASIPD)]. The daily physical activity was measured as the mean total accelerometer activity counts/day and the PASIPD scores as the metabolic equivalent (MET) hr/day. HRQL was assessed by the Physical and Mental composite scores of the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 (SF-36) in addition to the functional ability of the participants. Correlation and regression analyses were performed. Results: After controlling for the severity of the motor impairment, the amount of daily PA, as assessed by the PASIPD and accelerometers, was found to independently contribute to 10-12\% of the variance of the Physical Composite Score of the SF-36. No significant relationship was found between PA and the Mental Composite Score of the SF-36.The functional ability of the participants was found to be correlated to the amount of daily PA (r = 0.33 - 0.67, p {$<$} 0.01). Conclusion: The results suggest that daily PA is associated with better HRQL (as assessed by the Physical composite score of the SF-36) for people living with stroke. Daily PA should be encouraged to potentially increase HRQL. Accelerometers in conjunction with a self-report questionnaire may provide important measures of PA which can be monitored and modified, and potentially influence HRQL.},

We present a detection and classification approach that can be used to count the number of times certain motion gestures occur. The application presented involves tracking baseball throws and volleyball serves, which are common overhead movements that can lead to shoulder and elbow overuse injuries. Eleven subjects are recruited to collect training, testing, and randomized validation data, which include throws, serves, and seven other exercises that serve as a large null class of similar movements, which is analogous to a realistic usage scenario and requires a robust estimator.},

The present study is the first to demonstrate the possibility of analyzing three dimensional (3D) running mechanics continuously, by means of inertial magnetic measurement units, to objectify changes in mechanics over the course of a marathon. Three well trained male distance runners ran a marathon while equipped with inertial magnetic measurement units on trunk, pelvis, upper legs, lower legs and feet to obtain a 3D view of running mechanics and to asses changes in running mechanics over the course of a marathon. Data were continuously recorded during the entire 42.2~km (26.2~Miles) of the Marathon. Data from the individual sensors were transmitted wirelessly to a receiver, mounted on the handlebar of an accompanying cyclist. Anatomical calibration was performed using both static and dynamic procedures and sensor orientations were thus converted to body segment orientations by means of transformation matrices obtained from the segment calibration. Joint angle (hip, knee and ankle) trajectories as well as center of mass (COM) trajectory and acceleration were derived from the sensor data after segment calibration. Data were collected and repeated measures one way ANOVA׳s, with Tukey post-hoc test, were used to statistically analyze differences between the defined kinematic parameters (max hip angle, peak knee flexion at mid-stance and at mid-swing, ankle angle at initial contact and COM vertical displacement and acceleration), averaged over 100 strides, between the first and the last stages (8 and 40~km) of the marathon. Significant changes in running mechanics were witnessed between the first and the last stage of the marathon. This study showed the possibility of performing a 3D kinematic analysis of the running technique, in the sport specific setting, by using inertial magnetic measurement units. For the three runners analyzed, significant changes were observed in running mechanics over the course of a marathon. The present measurement technique therefore allows for more in-depth study of running mechanics outside the laboratory setting.},

Results:{\enspace} Community-based PA was safe (serious adverse events: PA vs health education, 0:2; nonserious adverse events: PA vs health education, 3:1) and participants successfully adhered to the PA intervention (65.2\%). Compared to health education, PA participants who attended {$\geq$}25\% of scheduled visits had meaningful and sustained short physical performance battery improvements at follow-up (between group short physical performance battery score differences: {\textasciitilde}0.7 units).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: and OBJECTIVE: Walking speed influences energy cost in healthy adults, but its influence when walking is impaired due to stroke is not clear. This study investigated the effect of manipulating walking speed on the energy economy of walking poststroke. METHODS: . Sixteen persons with chronic stroke underwent a clinical examination, including several lower extremity impairment measures. consumption (VO(2)) was measured as they walked at their self-selected speed (Free), 20\% slower (Slow), their fastest possible speed (Fastest), and 2 speeds between Free and Fastest speeds. VO(2) was normalized to body mass and speed, resulting in energy cost per meter walked (CW). RESULTS: . A main effect for speed was observed (P = .00001), with faster than self-selected speeds showing greater relative economy as a whole. However, for 5 subjects with the fastest walking speeds ({$>$}1.2 m/s), there was a trend toward decreasing relative economy at speeds higher than self-selected speed (P = .18). There was a negative correlation between improvement in CW at the most economical speed and (a) Free speed (r = -.857; P {$<$} .0001) and (b) lower extremity Fugl-Meyer scores (r = -.653; P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: . For those poststroke whose fastest walking speed after stroke is below 1.2 m/s, walking economy improves when speed is increased above the self-selected walking speed. The results suggest that for persons poststroke with very slow self-selected walking speeds, improvements in walking speed could be accompanied by improvements in walking economy if faster walking speeds can be attained through intervention.},

It begins by describing the different types of stroke that can occur in adults, their potential consequences on a person's capacity to function in daily life and statistics on the number of strokes and their burden on families and the economy. The assessment of stroke severity, recovery of function over time, and the impact of initial stroke severity and age on potential recovery are then addressed as well as the concept of rehabilitation to enhance recovery. Fueled by the synthesis of an ever-increasing research knowledge base and the creation of stroke rehabilitation recommendations for optimal delivery of rehabilitation services and of therapeutic interventions, stroke rehabilitation has changed dramatically. Examples of improvements in stroke rehabilitation in Canada are given with emphasis on the "best practices" inspired stroke rehabilitation continuum recently recommended for the Province of Quebec. The need for an improved community-based rehabilitation approach that includes regular follow-ups and community-based programs promoting reintegration is emphasized. The importance of knowledge translation strategies to promote the uptake of best-practice recommendations is illustrated by describing the activities of the Sensorimotor Rehabilitation Research Team. Over the past 3 years, the researchers of this team and clinicians in three rehabilitation centers, two in Montreal and one in Quebec City, have collaborated to adopt standardized assessment tools, create a common stroke registry, a best-practice recommended approach to interventions and the participation of clinicians in the research process.},

Linear power and anterior\vphantom\{\}posterior-induced acceleration (IA) analyses of the hip reveal that the lower limb joint's moments contribute to body forward propulsion primarily during late swing and early stance. Propulsive adaptations to speed changes occur primarily at the hip and secondarily at the ankle. These analyses show that hip muscles, particularly the hip extensors, are critical to propulsion. They also show that ankle function is primarily for support, but is important to propulsion, especially at slow speeds. 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Objective: To determine the effect of previous treatments of functional electric stimulation (FES) and transcutaneous electric stimulation (TENS) on improving gait speed in subjects poststroke. Data Sources: Relevant articles were obtained through a search of English-language articles cited in Medline, EMBASE, CINHAL, and PubMed databases from January 1966 to May 2005. Study Selection: Prospective clinical studies were included if electric stimulation was used to treat subjects poststroke and gait speed was used as an outcome measure. Excluded studies examined subjects with a variety of neurologic conditions, used implantable electrodes, or combined electric stimulation with treadmill training. A paired consensus between authors produced 8 articles. Data Extraction: Two investigators extracted data independently. The methodologic quality of the studies was assessed with the Downs and Black checklist. Data Synthesis: A fixed-effects model produced a mean difference (.18; 95\% confidence interval, .08-.28) that was significant (z=3.65, P{$<$}.01), indicating the effectiveness of FES treatment at increasing gait speed in subjects poststroke. The effect sizes of the studies ranged from -.11 to 1.43 for FES and .19 to .42 for TENS. The type of FES and TENS devices, location of electrodes, amount of exposure, and subjects' stages of recovery varied between the studies. Conclusions: FES is effective at improving gait speed in subjects poststroke. Future research should examine the effectiveness of practical and readily available FES units to improve function in subjects in the subacute stages of recovery from a stroke. These studies should attempt to use a randomized controlled design with blinding and standardized outcome measures. {\copyright} 2006 American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.},

  abstract = {The mechanical roles of tendon and muscle contractile elements during locomotion are often considered independently, but functionally they are tightly integrated. Tendons can enhance muscle performance for a wide range of locomotor activities because muscle-tendon units shorten and lengthen at velocities that would be mechanically unfavorable for muscle fibers functioning alone. During activities that require little net mechanical power output, such as steady-speed running, tendons reduce muscular work by storing and recovering cyclic changes in the mechanical energy of the body. Tendon stretch and recoil not only reduces muscular work, but also allows muscle fibers to operate nearly isometrically, where, due to the force-velocity relation, skeletal muscle fibers develop high forces. Elastic energy storage and recovery in tendons may also provide a key mechanism to enable individual muscles to alter their mechanical function, from isometric force-producers during steady speed running to actively shortening power-producers during high-power activities like acceleration or uphill running. Evidence from studies of muscle contraction and limb dynamics in turkeys suggests that during running accelerations work is transferred directly from muscle to tendon as tendon stretch early in the step is powered by muscle shortening. The energy stored in the tendon is later released to help power the increase in energy of the body. These tendon length changes redistribute muscle power, enabling contractile elements to shorten at relatively constant velocities and power outputs, independent of the pattern of flexion/extension at a joint. Tendon elastic energy storage and recovery extends the functional range of muscles by uncoupling the pattern of muscle fiber shortening from the pattern of movement of the body. {\copyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

This study compared modular control of gait between persons with Parkinson's disease (PD) and neurologically-healthy older adults (HOA) and investigated relationships between modular organization and gait parameters in persons with PD. Methods: Fifteen persons with idiopathic PD and fourteen HOA participated. Electromyographic recordings were made from eight leg muscles bilaterally while participants walked at their preferred walking speed for 10 min on an instrumented treadmill. Non-negative matrix factorization techniques decomposed the electromyographic signals, identifying the number and nature of modules accounting for 95\% of variability in muscle activations during treadmill walking. Results: Generally, fewer modules were required to reconstruct muscle activation patterns during treadmill walking in PD compared to HOA (p {$<$} .05). Control of knee flexor and ankle plantar flexor musculature was simplified in PD. Activation timing was altered in PD while muscle weightings were unaffected. Simplified neuromuscular control was related to decreased walking speed in PD. Conclusion: Neuromuscular control of gait is simplified in PD and may contribute to gait deficits in this population. Significance: Future studies of locomotor rehabilitation in PD should consider neuromuscular complexity to maximize intervention effectiveness. {\'O} 2013 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.

  abstract = {The purposes of this perspective article are: (1) to explore models of disability from the perspective of the academic discipline of disability studies (DS), (2) to consider the paradox of improving functional capacities while valuing disability as diversity, (3) to identify how physical therapy's use of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) disablement model intersects with various disability models, and (4) to apply this broader understanding of disability to physical therapist practice, education, and research. The DS literature has been critical of rehabilitation professionals, particularly targeting the medical model of disability. In contrast, advocates for a social model of disability recognize disability as diversity. It is paradoxical for physical therapy to simultaneously work to ameliorate disability while celebrating it as diversity. The ICF biopsychosocial disablement model offers a mechanism to practice within this paradox and suggests that it is no longer sufficient to conceptualize disability as a purely individual matter that requires attention in isolation from the impact of the larger society.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have suggested the biomechanical subtasks of walking can be produced by a reduced set of co-excited muscles or modules. Individuals post-stroke often exhibit poor inter-muscular coordination characterized by poor timing and merging of modules that are normally independent in healthy individuals. However, whether locomotor therapy can influence module composition and timing and whether these improvements lead to improved walking performance is unclear. The goal of this study was to examine the influence of a locomotor rehabilitation therapy on module composition and timing and post-stroke hemiparetic walking performance. Twenty-seven post-stroke hemiparetic subjects participated in a 12-week locomotor intervention incorporating treadmill training with body weight support and manual trainers accompanied by training overground walking. Electromyography (EMG), kinematic and ground reaction force data were collected from subjects both pre- and post-therapy and from 19 age-matched healthy controls walking on an instrumented treadmill at their self-selected speed. Non-negative matrix factorization was used to identify the module composition and timing from the EMG data. Module timing and composition, and various measures of walking performance were compared pre- and post-therapy.In subjects with four modules pre- and post-therapy, locomotor training resulted in improved timing of the ankle plantarflexor module and a more extended paretic leg angle that allowed the subjects to walk faster and with more symmetrical propulsion. In addition, subjects with three modules pre-therapy increased their number of modules and improved walking performance post-therapy. Thus, locomotor training has the potential to influence module composition and timing, which can lead to improvements walking performance. {\copyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Often patients suffer from foot drop, i.e. inability to lift the foot from the ground during the swing phase of walking. Functional electrical stimulation is commonly used to correct foot drop. For all supporting stimulation devices, it is vital to adequately detect the gait events, which is traditionally obtained by a foot switch placed under the heel. To investigate present methods of gait analysis and detection for use in ambulatory rehabilitation systems, we carried out a meta-analysis on research studies. We found various sensors and sensor combinations capable of analyzing gait in ambulatory settings, ranging form simple force based binary switches to complex setups involving multiple inertial sensors and advanced algorithms. However additional effort is needed to minimize donning/doffing efforts, to overcome cosmetical aspects, and to implement those systems into closed loop ambulatory devices.},

This study provides an algorithm to detect gait events in differential acceleration signals of the foot. The key feature of differential measurements is that they compensate the impact of gravity. The real time detection capability of a rule based algorithm in healthy and hemiparetic individuals was investigated. Detection accuracy and precision compared to signals from foot switches were evaluated. The algorithm detected curve features of the vectorial sum of radial and tangential accelerations and mapped those to discrete gait states. The results showed detection rates for healthy and hemiparetic gait ranging form 84.2\% to 108.5\%. The sensitivity was between 0.81 and 1, and the specificity between 0.85 and 1, depending on gait phase and group of subjects. The algorithm detected gait phase changes earlier than the reference. Differential acceleration signals combined with the proposed algorithm have the potential to be implemented in a future FES system.},

  abstract = {To enhance the wearability of portable motion-monitoring devices, the size and number of sensors are minimized, but at the expense of quality and quantity of data collected. For example, owing to the size and weight of low-frequency force transducers, most currently available wearable gait measurement systems provide only limited, if any, elements of ground reaction force (GRF) data. To obtain the most GRF information possible with a minimal use of sensors, we propose a GRF estimation method based on biomechanical knowledge of human walking. This includes the dynamics of the center of mass (CoM) during steady human gait resembling the oscillatory behaviors of a mass-spring system. Available measurement data were incorporated into a spring-loaded inverted pendulum with translating pivot. The spring stiffness and simulation parameters were tuned to match, as accurately as possible, the available data and oscillatory characteristics of walking. Our results showed that the model simulation estimated reasonably well the unmeasured GRF. Using the vertical GRF and CoP profile for gait speeds ranging from 0.93 to 1.89 m/s, the anterior-posterior (A-P) GRF was estimated and resulted in an average correlation coefficient of R = 0.982 {\textpm} 0.009. Even when the ground contact timing and gait speed information were alone available, our method estimated GRFs resulting in R = 0.969 {\textpm} 0.022 for the A-P and R = 0.891 {\textpm} 0.101 for the vertical GRFs. This research demonstrates that the biomechanical knowledge of human walking, such as inherited oscillatory characteristics of the CoM, can be used to gain unmeasured information regarding human gait dynamics.},

  abstract = {The proposed strap-down integration method exploits the cyclical nature of human gait: during the gait swing phase, the quaternion-based attitude representation is integrated using a gyroscope from initial conditions that are determined during stance by an accelerometer. Positioning requires double time integration of the gravity-compensated accelerometer signals during swing. An interpolation technique applied to attitude quaternions was developed to improve the accuracy of orientation and positioning estimates by accounting for the effect of sensor bias and scale factor drifts. A simulation environment was developed for the analysis and testing of the proposed algorithm on a synthetic movement trajectory. The aim was to define the true attitude and positioning used in the computation of estimation errors. By thermal modelling, the changes of bias and scale factor of the inertial sensors, calibrated at a single reference temperature, were analysed over a range of 4- 10 {$^\circ$} C, for measurement noise standard deviations up to O-g= 2.5 {$^\circ$} s 7 (gyroscope) and o-a= 0.05 m s 2 (accelerometer). The compensation technique reduced the maximum root mean square errors (RMSEs) to: RMSEo-14.6 {$^\circ$} (orientation) and RMSEd-17.7cm (positioning) for an integration interval of one gait cycle (an improvement of 3 {$^\circ$} and 7cm); R M S E o - 14.8 {$^\circ$} and R M S E d - 30.0 cm for an integration interval of two gait cycles (an improvement of 11{$^\circ$} and 262 cm).},

  abstract = {We present a method called muscle synergy analysis, which can offer clinicians insight into both underlying neural strategies for movement and functional outcomes of muscle activity. Although neural dysfunction is central to many motor deficits, neural activity during movements is not directly measurable. Consequently, the majority of clinical tests focus on evaluating motor outputs at the behavioral and kinematic levels. However, altered behavioral or kinematic outcomes could be the result of multiple distinct neural abnormalities with very different muscle coordination patterns. Because muscle activity reflects motoneuron activity and generates the forces that produce behavioral outcomes, an analysis of muscle activity may provide a better understanding of the functional neural deficits in the impaired nervous system. Unfortunately electromyographic datasets can be large, highly variable, and difficult to interpret, precluding their clinical utility. Computational analyses can be used to extract muscle synergies from such datasets, revealing underlying patterns that may reflect different levels of neural function. These muscle synergies are hypothesized to represent motor modules recruited by the nervous system to flexibly perform biomechanical subtasks necessary for movement. For example, hemiparetic stroke patients exhibit differences in the number of muscle synergies, which may reflect disruptions in descending neural pathways and are correlated to deficits in motor function. Muscle synergy analysis may thus offer the clinician a better view of the neural structure underlying motor behaviors and how they change in motor deficits and rehabilitation. Such information could inform diagnostic tools and evidence- based interventions specifically targeted to a patient's deficits.},

  abstract = {An ambulatory gait analysis method using bodyattached gyroscopes to estimate spatio-temporal parameters of gait has been proposed and validated against a reference system for normal and pathologic gait. Later, ten Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) implantation participated in gait measurements using our device. They walked one to three times on a 20-m walkway. Patients did the test twice: once STN-DBS was ON and once 180 min after turning it OFF. A group of ten age-matched normal subjects were also measured as controls. For each gait cycle, spatio-temporal parameters such as stride length (SL), stride velocity (SV), stance (ST), double support (DS), and gait cycle time (GC) were calculated. We found that PD patients had significantly different gait parameters comparing to controls. They had 52\% less SV, 60\% less SL, and 40\% longer GC. Also they had significantly longer ST and DS (11\% and 59\% more, respectively) than controls. STN-DBS significantly improved gait parameters. During the stim ON period, PD patients had 31\% faster SV, 26\% longer SL, 6\% shorter ST, and 26\% shorter DS. GC, however, was not significantly different. Some of the gait parameters had high correlation with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) subscores including SL with a significant correlation ( = 0 90) with UPDRS gait subscore. We concluded that our method provides a simple yet effective way of ambulatory gait analysis in PD patients with results confirming those obtained from much more complex and expensive methods used in gait labs.},

Interventions: Five- (5mWT) and 10-meter walk tests (10mWT) at comfortable and maximum speeds, with 2 evaluations conducted an average {\textpm} standard deviation (SD) of 8 {\textpm} 3 and 38 {\textpm} 5 days poststroke. Main Outcome Measure: Standardized response mean (SRM = mean change/SD of change) was used to estimate responsiveness for each walk test, the Berg Balance Scale, the Barthel Index, the Stroke Rehabilitation Assessment of Movement (STREAM), and the Timed Up and Go (TUG). Results: The SRMs were 1.22 and 1.00 for the 5mWT, and .92 and .83 for the 10mWT performed at a comfortable and maximum pace, respectively. The SRMs for the Berg Balance Scale, the Barthel Index, the STREAM, and the TUG were 1.04, .99, .89, and .73, respectively. The probability of discharge to a rehabilitation center for persons walking at {$\leq$} 0.3/s or {$>$} 0.6m/s at the first evaluation was .95 and .22, respectively.

Emphasis is placed on how such forms are distinguished from one another, in part, by the set of topological patterns of physical contact between agent and environment (i.e., the set of physical graphs associated with each form) and the transitions among these patterns displayed over the course of performance (i.e., the form's physical graph dynamics). Crucial in this regard is the creation and dissolution of loops in these graphs, which can be related to the distinction between open and closed kinematic chains. Formal similarities are described within the theoretical framework of task-dynamics between physically-closed kinematic chains (physical loops) that are created during various movement forms and functionally-closed kinematic chains (functional loops) that are associated with task-space control of end-effectors; it is argued that both types of loop must be flexibly incorporated into the coordinative structures that govern skilled action. Final speculation is focused on the role of graphs and their dynamics, not only in processes of coordination and control for individual agents, but also in processes of inter-agent coordination and the coupling of agents with (non-sentient) environmental objects.},

The adoption of the concept that fundamentally locomotion is the translation of the center of gravity through space along a pathway requiring the least expenditure of energy supplies the necessary unifying principle which permits of qualitative analysis in terms of the essential determinants of gait. The six major determinants are pelvic rotation, pelvic tilt, knee and hip flexion, knee and ankle interaction, and lateral pelvic displacement. The serial observations of irregularities in these determinants provides insight into individual variation and a dynamic assessment of pathological gait. Pathological gait may be viewed as an attempt to preserve as low a level of energy consumption as possible by exaggerations of the motions at unaffected levels. Compensation is reasonably effective with the loss of one determinant of which that at the knee is the most costly. Loss of two determinants makes effective compensation impossible and the cost of locomotion in terms of energy is increased threefold with an inevitable drain upon the body economy.},

Here we tested the hypothesis that long-term training leading to skilled motor performance alters muscle coordination during challenging, as well as nominal everyday motor behaviors. Using motor module (a.k.a., muscle synergy) analyses, we identified differences in muscle coordination patterns between professionally trained ballet dancers (experts) and untrained novices that accompanied differences in walking balance proficiency assessed using a challenging beam-walking test. During beam walking, we found that experts recruited more motor modules than novices, suggesting an increase in motor repertoire size. Motor modules in experts had less muscle coactivity and were more consistent than in novices, reflecting greater efficiency in muscle output. Moreover, the pool of motor modules shared between beam and overground walking was larger in experts compared with novices, suggesting greater generalization of motor module function across multiple behaviors. These differences in motor output between experts and novices could not be explained by differences in kinematics, suggesting that they likely reflect differences in the neural control of movement following years of training rather than biomechanical constraints imposed by the activity or musculoskeletal structure and function. Our results suggest that to learn challenging new behaviors, we may take advantage of existing motor modules used for related behaviors and sculpt them to meet the demands of a new behavior.},

  abstract = {We characterized how hemiparetic stroke survivors and neurologically intact individuals adapt reaching movements to compensate for unpredictable environmental perturbations. We tested the hypotheses that like unimpaired subjects, hemiparetic stroke survivors adapt using sensory information obtained during only the most recent movements and that the reliability of target acquisition decreases as the degree of sensorimotor impairment increases. Subjects held the handle of a two-joint robotic arm that applied forces to the hand while reaching between targets in a horizontal plane. The robot simulated a dynamic environment that varied randomly in strength from one trial to the next. The trial sequence of perturbations had a nonzero mean value corresponding to information about the environment that subjects might learn. Stroke subjects were less effective than control subjects at adapting reaches to the perturbations. From a family of potential adaptation models, we found that the compensatory strategy patients used was the same as that used by neurologically intact subjects. However, analysis of model coefficients found that the relative weighting of prior perturbations and prior movement errors on subsequent reach attempts was significantly depressed poststroke. Regulation of final hand position was also impaired in the paretic limbs. Measures of trajectory adaptation and final position regulation deficits were significantly dependent on the integrity of limb proprioception and the amount of time poststroke. However, whereas model coefficients varied systematically with impairment level poststroke, variability of final positioning in the contralesional limb did not. This difference suggests that these two aspects of limb control may be differentially impaired poststroke.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND In individuals with post-stroke hemiparesis, reduced push-off force generation in the paretic leg negatively impacts walking function. Gait training interventions that increase paretic push-off can improve walking function in individuals with neurologic impairment. During normal locomotion, push-off forces are modulated with variations in gait speed and slope. However, it is unknown whether able-bodied individuals can selectively modulate push-off forces from one leg in response to biofeedback. Here, in a group of young, neurologically-unimpaired individuals, we determined the effects of a real-time visual and auditory biofeedback gait training paradigm aimed at unilaterally increasing anteriorly-directed ground reaction force (AGRF) in the targeted leg. METHODS Ground reaction force data during were collected from 7 able-bodied individuals as they walked at a self-selected pace on a dual-belt treadmill instrumented with force platforms. During 11-min of gait training, study participants were provided real-time AGRF biofeedback encouraging a 20-30\% increase in peak AGRF generated by their right (targeted) leg compared to their baseline (pre-training) AGRF. AGRF data were collected before, during, and after the biofeedback training period, as well as during two retention tests performed without biofeedback and after standing breaks. RESULTS Compared to AGRFs generated during the pre-training gait trials, participants demonstrated a significantly greater AGRF in the targeted leg during and immediately after training, indicating that biofeedback training was successful at inducing increased AGRF production in the targeted leg. Additionally, participants continued to demonstrate greater AGRF production in the targeted leg after two standing breaks, showing short-term recall of the gait pattern learned during the biofeedback training. No significant effects of training were observed on the AGRF in the non-targeted limb, showing the specificity of the effects of biofeedback toward the targeted limb. CONCLUSIONS These results demonstrate the short-term effects of using unilateral AGRF biofeedback to target propulsion in a specific leg, which may have utility as a training tool for individuals with gait deficits such as post-stroke hemiparesis. Future studies are needed to investigate the effects of real-time AGRF biofeedback as a gait training tool in neurologically-impaired individuals.},

  abstract = {Stride parameters like step length, step rate or stance duration during sprinting represent basic and very useful information for track and field coaches. Contact mats or opto-electronic systems like Optojump allow precise and unobtrusive measurements of theses parameters, but their use is limited in space. Inertial measurement units (IMUs) are not bound to these limitations and therefore offer challenging opportunities for in-field diagnosis, especially if combined with wireless data transmission. IMUs have already been used to detect kinematic parameters in track and field but data analysis can typically only be done offline. In this study, we present an IMU-based wearable measurement system for field-based performance analysis and online monitoring, that allows an accurate detection of step parameters in sprinting. Twelve track and field athletes (10 male, 2 female) performed maximal sprints wearing the IMU attached to both ankles. The OptojumpNext photocell system (Microgate, Bolzano, Italy) was used as reference system. Data acquisition rate for both devices was 1000 Hz. Stance durations (tS) during the phase of maximal velocity are extracted onboard from the accelerometer and gyroscope signal and then sent to an external device. Out of 380 contacts, 364 were detected correctly (96\%). tS showed a mean difference of -2.5{\textpm}4.8ms between OptojumpNext and IMU. Bland-Altman plots derive a 95\% limit of agreement (LOA) in the range from 6.8 to -11.8 ms. Hence, the system enables providing reliable and accurate objective real-time feedback for a group of athletes during a training session or competition.},

Previous research suggests that the energetic cost of walking at preferred speed is inversely associated with gait speed, but whether individuals with a rising energetic cost of walking experience a steeper rate of gait speed decline has not been investigated.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: In participants of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, the energetic cost of overground walking at preferred speed (mL/kg/m) was assessed between 2007 and 2014 using a portable indirect calorimeter. The longitudinal association between the energetic cost of walking and usual gait speed over 6 meters (m/s) was assessed with multivariate linear regression models, and the risk of slow gait ({$<$}1.0 m/s) was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: The study population consisted of 457 participants aged 40 and older who contributed 1,121 person-visits to the analysis. In fully adjusted models, increases in the energetic cost of walking predicted the rate of gait speed decline in those older than 65 years ({$\beta$} = -0.008 m/s, p {$<$} .001). Moreover, those with a higher energetic cost of walking ({$>$}0.17mL/kg/m) had a 57\% greater risk of developing slow gait compared with a normal energetic cost of walking ({$\leq$}0.17mL/kg/m; adjusted hazard ratio = 1.57, 95\% confidence interval: 1.01-2.46).{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that strategies to maintain walking efficiency hold significant implications for maintaining mobility in late life. Efforts to curb threats to walking efficiency should focus on therapies to treat gait and balance impairments, and reduce clinical disease burden.},

Unlike most robotic devices, the human body lacks even surfaces and right angles. Therefore, we focus on methods that avoid assuming certain orientations in which the sensors are mounted with respect to the body segments. After a review of available methods that may cope with this challenge, we present a set of new methods for: (1) joint axis and position identification; and (2) flexion/extension joint angle measurement. In particular, we propose methods that use only gyroscopes and accelerometers and, therefore, do not rely on a homogeneous magnetic field. We provide results from gait trials of a transfemoral amputee in which we compare the inertial measurement unit (IMU)-based methods to an optical 3D motion capture system. Unlike most authors, we place the optical markers on anatomical landmarks instead of attaching them to the IMUs. Root mean square errors of the knee flexion/extension angles are found to be less than 1{$^\circ$} on the prosthesis and about 3{$^\circ$} on the human leg. For the plantar/dorsiflexion of the ankle, both deviations are about 1{$^\circ$}.},

Here we discuss how a neurobiological system property, degeneracy (i.e., many coordinative structures to achieve one function), can help us understand how skilled individuals functionally adapt perception and action to interacting constraints during performance. Since most research investigating degeneracy has been conducted in neuroanatomy, genetics and theoretical neurobiology, here we clarify how degeneracy is exhibited in perceptual-motor systems. Using an ecological dynamics framework, we highlight how degeneracy underpins the functional role of movement coordination variability in performance of multi-articular tasks. Following that, we discuss how degenerate neurobiological systems are able to exploit system stability and flexibility in their movement coordination. Third, we show how better coupling of information and movement could lead individuals to explore functionally degenerate behaviors. Last, we explore how degeneracy can support pluri-potentiality (i.e., one coordinative structure for many perceptual-motor functions) as a way toward innovation or refinement in performance.},

Subjects were instrumented with two uniaxial accelerometers just below the knee while synchronized ground reaction force (GRF) recordings were used as reference measurements. An automated multiphase algorithm was developed to estimate the time of IC and TC in the acceleration signals of five healthy subjects and two transtibial amputees walking at different walking speeds. The accuracy of the detection algorithm in ten control subjects and eight transtibial amputees indicated mean errors ranging between 0.013 and 0.034 s for the TC and IC timing, with 95\% confidence interval of the individual step errors ranging between -0.062 and 0.115 s. Correlation coefficients between the estimated stance phase duration and GRF data were 0.98 and 0.97 for controls and amputees, respectively. We concluded that IC and TC can be accurately and easily measured using this system in both healthy subjects and transtibial amputees walking at different walking speeds.

More recently, the motor system has been subject to quantitative and computational characterization. The purpose of this review is to argue that the lesion approach and theoretical motor control can mutually inform each other. Specifically, one may identify distinct motor control processes from computational models and map them onto specific deficits in patients. Here we review some of the impairments in motor control, motor learning and higher-order motor control in patients with lesions of the corticospinal tract, the cerebellum, parietal cortex, the basal ganglia, and the medial temporal lobe. We attempt to explain some of these impairments in terms of computational ideas such as state estimation, optimization, prediction, cost, and reward. We suggest that a function of the cerebellum is system identification: to build internal models that predict sensory outcome of motor commands and correct motor commands through internal feedback. A function of the parietal cortex is state estimation: to integrate the predicted proprioceptive and visual outcomes with sensory feedback to form a belief about how the commands affected the states of the body and the environment. A function of basal ganglia is related to optimal control: learning costs and rewards associated with sensory states and estimating the "cost-to-go" during execution of a motor task. Finally, functions of the primary and the premotor cortices are related to implementing the optimal control policy by transforming beliefs about proprioceptive and visual states, respectively, into motor commands.},

  abstract = {Monitoring natural human gait in real-life environments is essential in many applications, including quantification of disease progression, monitoring the effects of treatment, and monitoring alteration of performance biomarkers in professional sports. Walking ground reaction forces are among the key parameters necessary for gait analysis. However, these parameters are commonly measured using force plates or instrumented treadmills which are expensive and bulky and can only be used in a controlled laboratory environment. Despite the importance of real-life gait measurement, developing reliable and practical techniques and technologies necessary for continuous real-life monitoring of gait is still an open challenge, mainly due to the lack of a practical and cost-effective wearable technology for ground reaction force measurement. This paper presents a methodology to estimate the total walking ground reaction force GRFv {\dh}t{\TH} in the vertical direction using data from a single inertial measurement unit. Correlation analysis of the vertical acceleration of different body segments with GRFv {\dh}t{\TH} indicated that the 7th cervical vertebrae is one of the best locations for the sensor. The proposed method improves the accuracy of the state-of-the-art GRFv {\dh}t{\TH} estimation by 25\%, by utilising the time-varying ratio of the vertical acceleration of the human body centre of mass and measured C7 vertical acceleration. Results of this study showed that the proposed method estimated consistently the GRFv {\dh}t{\TH} in both indoor and urban outdoor environment, with a 4--8\% peak-to-peak normalised root mean square error.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of miniaturized electronics has fueled a shift toward wearable sensors and feedback devices for the mass population. Quantified self and other similar movements involving wearable systems have gained recent interest. However, it is unclear what the clinical impact of these enabling technologies is on human gait. The purpose of this review is to assess clinical applications of wearable sensing and feedback for human gait and to identify areas of future research. Four electronic databases were searched to find articles employing wearable sensing or feedback for movements of the foot, ankle, shank, thigh, hip, pelvis, and trunk during gait. We retrieved 76 articles that met the inclusion criteria and identified four common clinical applications: (1) identifying movement disorders, (2) assessing surgical outcomes, (3) improving walking stability, and (4) reducing joint loading. Characteristics of knee and trunk motion were the most frequent gait parameters for both wearable sensing and wearable feedback. Most articles performed testing on healthy subjects, and the most prevalent patient populations were osteoarthritis, vestibular loss, Parkinson's disease, and post-stroke hemiplegia. The most widely used wearable sensors were inertial measurement units (accelerometer and gyroscope packaged together) and goniometers. Haptic (touch) and auditory were the most common feedback sensations. This review highlights the current state of the literature and demonstrates substantial potential clinical benefits of wearable sensing and feedback. Future research should focus on wearable sensing and feedback in patient populations, in natural human environments outside the laboratory such as at home or work, and on continuous, long-term monitoring and intervention. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

However, discussion of the way to most effectively provide augmented feedback has been controversial. Related studies have focused primarily on simple or artificial tasks enhanced by visual feedback. Recently, technical advances have made it possible also to investigate more complex, realistic motor tasks and to implement not only visual, but also auditory, haptic, or multimodal augmented feedback. The aim of this review is to address the potential of augmented unimodal and multimodal feedback in the framework of motor learning theories. The review addresses the reasons for the different impacts of feedback strategies within or between the visual, auditory, and haptic modalities and the challenges that need to be overcome to provide appropriate feedback in these modalities, either in isolation or in combination. Accordingly, the design criteria for successful visual, auditory, haptic, and multimodal feedback are elaborated.},

Twenty healthy young (18--35 years) and 20 healthy older (65--85 years) adults participated in this study. We measured subject-specific passive-elastic joint moment--angle relationships in the lower extremity and tested maximum isokinetic ankle strength at 30 deg/s. Passive moment--angle relationships were used to estimate active and passive joint moment, power, and work quantities during walking at 80\%, 100\% and 120\% of preferred walking speed. There were no significant differences in walking speed, step length, or cadence between the older and young adults. However, the older adults produced significantly more net positive work at the hip but less net positive work at the ankle at all walking speeds. Passive contributions to hip and ankle work did not significantly differ between groups, inferring that the older adults generated the additional hip work actively. Maximum isokinetic ankle strength was significantly less in the older adults, and correlated with peak positive plantar-flexor power at both the preferred and fast walking speeds. The results of this study suggest that age-related shifts in joint kinetics do not arise as a result of increased passive hip joint stiffness, but seem to be reflected in plantar-flexor weakness.},

  abstract = {A real-time method for the detection of gait events that occur during the electrically stimulated locomotion of paraplegic subjects is described. It consists of a two-level algorithm for the processing of sensor signals and the determination of gait event times. Sensor signals and information about the progression of the stimulator though its pre-specified stimulation "pattern" are processed by a machine intelligence (fuzzy logic) algorithm to determine an initial estimate of the patient's current phase of gait. This is then reviewed and modified by a second algorithm that removes spurious gait estimates, and determines gait event times. These gait event times are known to the system within approximately one-half of a gait cycle. The resulting gait event detection system was successfully evaluated on three subjects. Detection accuracy is not adversely affected by day-to-day gait variability. This work resolved technical and practical issues that previously limited the real time application of these methods. In particular, cosmetically acceptable insole force transducers were used. This gait event detector is designed for use in a real time controller for the automatic adjustment of the intensity and timing of stimulation while the subject is walking using functional electrical stimulation.},

We demonstrate that all detectors can be derived within the same general likelihood ratio test (LRT) framework, given the different prior knowledge about the sensor signals. Further, by combining all prior knowledge, we derive a new LRT detector. Subsequently, we develop a methodology to evaluate the performance of the detectors. Employing the developed methodology, we evaluate the performance of the detectors using leveled ground, slow (approximately 3 km/h) and normal (approximately 5 km/h) gait data. The test results are presented in terms of detection versus false-alarm probability. Our preliminary results show that the new detector performs marginally better than the angular rate energy detector that outperforms both the acceleration-moving variance detector and the acceleration-magnitude detector.},

  abstract = {Force-sensing resistors (FSRs) were used to detect the transitions between five main phases of gait for the control of electrical stimulation (ES) while walking with seven children with spastic diplegia, cerebral palsy. The FSR positions within each child's insoles were customized based on plantar pressure profiles determined using a pressure-sensitive membrane array (Tekscan Inc., Boston, MA). The FSRs were placed in the insoles so that pressure transitions coincided with an ipsilateral or contralateral gait event. The transitions between the following gait phases were determined: loading response, mid- and terminal stance, and pre- and initial swing. Following several months of walking on a regular basis with FSR-triggered intramuscular ES to the hip and knee extensors, hip abductors, and ankle dorsi and plantar flexors, the accuracy and reliability of the FSRs to detect gait phase transitions were evaluated. Accuracy was evaluated with four of the subjects by synchronizing the output of the FSR detection scheme with a VICON (Oxford Metrics, U.K.) motion analysis system, which was used as the gait event reference. While mean differences between each FSR-detected gait event and that of the standard (VICON) ranged from +35 ms (indicating that the FSR detection scheme recognized the event before it actually happened) to -55 ms (indicating that the FSR scheme recognized the event after it occurred), the difference data was widely distributed, which appeared to be due in part to both intrasubject (step-to-step) and intersubject variability. Terminal stance exhibited the largest mean difference and standard deviation, while initial swing exhibited the smallest deviation and preswing the smallest mean difference. To determine step-to-step reliability, all seven children walked on a level walkway for at least 50 steps. Of 642 steps, there were no detection errors in 94.5\% of the steps. Of the steps that contained a detection error, 80\% were due to the failure of the FSR signal to reach the programmed threshold level during the transition to loading response. Recovery from an error always occurred one to three steps later.},

(2005) Nature 434:755-759], but why our unique two-legged gait evolved remains unknown. Here, we analyze walking energetics and biomechanics for adult chimpanzees and humans to investigate the long-standing hypothesis that bipedalism reduced the energy cost of walking compared with our ape-like ancestors [Rodman PS, McHenry HM (1980) Am J Phys Anthropol 52:103-106]. Consistent with previous work on juvenile chimpanzees [Taylor CR, Rowntree VJ (1973) Science 179:186-187], we find that bipedal and quadrupedal walking costs are not significantly different in our sample of adult chimpanzees. However, a more detailed analysis reveals significant differences in bipedal and quadrupedal cost in most individuals, which are masked when subjects are examined as a group. Furthermore, human walking is approximately 75\% less costly than both quadrupedal and bipedal walking in chimpanzees. Variation in cost between bipedal and quadrupedal walking, as well as between chimpanzees and humans, is well explained by biomechanical differences in anatomy and gait, with the decreased cost of human walking attributable to our more extended hip and a longer hindlimb. Analyses of these features in early fossil hominins, coupled with analyses of bipedal walking in chimpanzees, indicate that bipedalism in early, ape-like hominins could indeed have been less costly than quadrupedal knucklewalking.},

  abstract = {In human walking, each transition to a new stance limb requires redirection of the center of mass (COM) velocity from one inverted pendulum arc to the next. While this can be accomplished with either negative collision work by the leading limb, positive push-off work by the trailing limb, or some combination of the two, physics-based models of step-to-step transitions predict that total positive work is minimized when the push-off and collision work are equal in magnitude. Here, we tested the importance of the coordination of push-off and collision work in determining transition work using ankle and knee joint braces to limit the ability of a leg to perform positive work on the body. To isolate transitions from other contributors to walking mechanics, participants were instructed to rock back and forth from one leg to the other, restricting motion to the sagittal plane and eliminating the need to swing the legs. We found that reduced push-off work increased the collision work required to complete the redirection of the COM velocity during each transition. A greater amount of total mechanical work was required when rocking departed from the predicted optimal coordination of step-to-step transitions, in which push-off and collision work are equal in magnitude. Our finding that transition work increases if one or both legs do not push-off with the optimal coordination may help explain the elevated metabolic cost of pathological gait irrespective of etiology.},

Main Outcome Measures Bilateral lower limbs electromyographic activity of the soleus (SOL), gastrocnemius medialis, tibialis anterior, biceps femoris, rectus femoris, and vastus medialis (VM) muscles and the ground reaction force were analyzed during double-support and terminal stance phases of gait. Results The propulsive impulse of the contralesional trailing limb was negatively correlated with the braking impulse of the leading limb during double support (r=-.639, P=.01). A moderate functional relation was observed between thigh muscles (r=-.529, P=.035), and a strong and moderate dysfunctional relation was found between the plantar flexors of the ipsilesional limb and the vastus medialis of the contralesional limb, respectively (SOL-VM, r=-.80, P{$<$}.001; gastrocnemius medialis-VM, r=-.655, P=.002). Also, a functional moderate negative correlation was found between the SOL and rectus femoris muscles of the ipsilesional limb during terminal stance and between the SOL (r=-.506, P=.046) and VM (r=-.518, P=.04) muscles of the contralesional limb during loading response, respectively. The trailing limb relative impulse contribution of the contralesional limb was lower than the ipsilesional limb of subjects with stroke (P=.02) and lower than the relative impulse contribution of the healthy limb (P=.008) during double support. Conclusions The findings obtained suggest that the lower performance of the contralesional limb in forward propulsion during gait is related not only to contralateral supraspinal damage but also to a dysfunctional influence of the ipsilesional limb. {\copyright} 2013 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine.},

Objective and subjective outcomes of interest included surgical technique, rehabilitation, instrumented laxity, isokinetic strength, patellofemoral pain, return to preinjury activity, and Tegner, Lysholm, Cincinnati, and International Knee Documentation Committee-1991 scores. Additional surgery, graft failure, and complications were reviewed. Slight increased laxity on arthrometer testing was seen in the hamstring population in 3 of 7 studies. Pain with kneeling was greater for the patellar tendon population in 4 of 4 studies. Only 1 of 9 studies showed increased anterior knee pain in the patellar tendon group. Frequency of additional surgery seemed to be related to the fixation method and not graft type. No study reported a significant difference in graft failure between patellar tendon and hamstring tendon autografts. Objective differences (range of motion, isokinetic strength, arthrometer testing) were not detected between groups in the majority of studies, suggesting that their sensitivity to detect clinical outcomes may be limited. Increased kneeling pain in the patellar tendon group was seen consistently in the studies evaluated. Subjective differences in anterior knee pain or return-to-activity level were not consistently observed in these studies. With numbers available, failure rates were not significantly different between groups. These findings suggest that graft type may not be the primary determinant for successful outcomes after anterior cruciate ligament surgery.},

Considering the fact that each individual has a unique way of walking, inertial sensors can be applied to the problem of gait recognition where assessed gait can be interpreted as a biometric trait. Thus, inertial sensor-based gait recognition has a great potential to play an important role in many security-related applications. Since inertial sensors are included in smart devices that are nowadays present at every step, inertial sensor-based gait recognition has become very attractive and emerging field of research that has provided many interesting discoveries recently. This paper provides a thorough and systematic review of current state-of-the-art in this field of research. Review procedure has revealed that the latest advanced inertial sensor-based gait recognition approaches are able to sufficiently recognise the users when relying on inertial data obtained during gait by single commercially available smart device in controlled circumstances, including fixed placement and small variations in gait. Furthermore, these approaches have also revealed considerable breakthrough by realistic use in uncontrolled circumstances, showing great potential for their further development and wide applicability.},

  abstract = {Background Approximately two out of three individuals post-stroke experience walking impairments. Frontal plane compensatory strategies (i.e. pelvic hiking and circumduction) are observed in post-stroke gait in part to achieve foot clearance in response to reduced knee flexion and ankle dorsiflexion. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between self-selected walking speed and the kinematic patterns related to paretic foot clearance during post-stroke walking. Methods Gait analysis was performed at self-selected walking speed for 21 individuals post-stroke. Four kinematic variables were calculated during the swing phase of the paretic limb: peak pelvic tilt (pelvic hiking), peak hip abduction (circumduction), peak knee flexion, and peak ankle dorsiflexion. Paretic joint angles were analyzed across self-selected walking speed as well as between functionally relevant ambulation categories (Household {$<$} 0.4 m/s, Limited Community 0.4-0.8 m/s, Community {$>$} 0.8 m/s). Findings While all subjects exhibited similar foot clearance, slower walkers exhibited greater peak pelvic hiking and less knee flexion, ankle dorsiflexion, and circumduction compared to faster walkers (P {$<$}.05). Additionally, four of the fastest walkers compensated for poor knee flexion and ankle dorsiflexion through large amounts of circumduction. Interpretation These findings suggest that improved gait performance after stroke, as measured by self-selected walking speed, is not necessarily always accomplished through gait patterns that more closely resemble healthy gait for all variables. It appears the ability to walk fast is achieved by either sufficient ankle dorsiflexion and knee flexion to achieve foot clearance or the employment of circumduction to overcome a deficit in either ankle dorsiflexion or knee flexion. {\copyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Question: Is biofeedback during the practice of lower limb activities after stroke more effective than usual therapy in improving those activities, and are any benefits maintained beyond the intervention? Design: Systematic review with meta-analysis of randomised trials with a PEDro score {$>$} 4. Participants: People who have had a stroke. Intervention: Biofeedback (any type delivered by any signal or sense) delivered concurrently during practice of sitting, standing up, standing or walking compared with the same amount of practice without biofeedback. Outcome measures: Measures of activity congruent with the activity trained. Results: Eighteen trials including 429 participants met the inclusion criteria. The quality of the included trials was moderately high, with a mean PEDro score of 6.2 out of 10. The pooled effect size was calculated as a standardised mean difference (SMD) because different outcome measures were used. Biofeedback improved performance of activities more than usual therapy (SMD 0.50, 95\% CI 0.30 to 0.70). Conclusion: Biofeedback is more effective than usual therapy in improving performance of activities. Further research is required to determine the long-term effect on learning. Given that many biofeedback machines are relatively inexpensive, biofeedback could be utilised widely in clinical practice.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:: Overground gait training-observation and cueing of patient's walking pattern along with related exercises-forms a major part of rehabilitation services for individuals with chronic stroke in almost every setting. This report of a Cochrane systematic review assessed the effects of overground gait training on walking ability for individuals with mobility deficits subsequent to chronic stroke. DATA SOURCES:: We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Science Citation Index Expanded, http://www.clinicaltrials.gov, among other databases through spring 2008. We also searched reference lists and contacted authors and trial investigators. REVIEW METHODS:: Only randomized controlled trials comparing overground physical therapy gait training with a placebo or no treatment condition were included. RESULTS:: Nine studies involving 499 participants were included. We found no evidence of a benefit on walking function, the primary variable, based on three studies (n = 269). Some performance variables did show significant effects. Walking speed increased by 0.07 m/sec [95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.05-0.10] based on seven studies (n = 396), Timed Up and Go test improved by 1.81 seconds (95\% CI, -2.29 to -1.33) based on three studies (n = 118), and six-minute walk test increased by 26.06 m (95\% CI, 7.14-44.97) based on four studies (n = 181). CONCLUSIONS:: We found insufficient evidence to determine whether overground physical therapy gait training benefits walking function in individuals with chronic stroke, although limited evidence suggests potential benefits for some performance variables. High-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to replicate and extend these findings.},

Understanding how neuromuscular control is altered in CP can provide insight into pathological movement. We sought to determine if individuals with CP demonstrate reduced complexity of neuromuscular control during gait compared with unimpaired individuals and if changes in control are related to functional ability. METHOD Muscle synergies during gait were retrospectively analyzed for 633 individuals (age range 3.9--70y): 549 with CP (hemiplegia, n=122; diplegia, n=266; triplegia, n=73; quadriplegia, n=88) and 84 unimpaired individuals. Synergies were calculated using non-negative matrix factorization from surface electromyography collected during previous clinical gait analyses. Synergy complexity during gait was compared with diagnosis subtype, functional ability, and clinical examination measures. RESULT Fewer synergies were required to describe muscle activity during gait in individuals with CP compared with unimpaired individuals. Changes in synergies were related to functional impairment and clinical examination measures including selective motor control, strength, and spasticity. INTERPRETATION Individuals with CP use a simplified control strategy during gait compared with unimpaired individuals. These results were similar to synergies during walking among adult stroke survivors, suggesting similar neuromuscular control strategies between these clinical populations.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To determine agreement between temporospatial gait parameters derived from an electronic walkway and a video-based motion capture system in healthy and chronic stroke subjects. Design: Data were acquired simultaneously by a walkway (GAITRite) and an eight-camera motion capture system (Motion Analysis Corporation) in 52 healthy subjects (age 47 Ϯ 15 yrs) and 20 people with stroke (age, 58 Ϯ 20 yrs; 4 Ϯ 7 yrs poststroke). Gait velocity, stride time, stride length, step length, percent single support, and percent total support were compared by the limits-of-agreement method. Results: The mean differences between the two methods were small and measured 1.5\% or less of the parameter mean value. The velocity difference was significantly (P Ͻ 0.001) larger in healthy (1.37 Ϯ 0.93 cm/sec) than in stroke subjects (0.50 Ϯ 0.63) and in stroke subjects who did not use an assistive device (0.75 Ϯ 0.67 cm/sec) compared with those who did (0.13 Ϯ 0.32). Conclusions: Electronic walkway and video-based gait analysis provide comparable temporospatial gait information in healthy and stroke subjects. The differences between the two methods were greater with increasing speed but overall still negligible considering expected changes resulting from stroke recovery, experimental manipulations, or therapeutic interventions. Therefore, electronic walkway and video-based gait analysis may be used interchangeably for evaluating temporospatial gait parameters after stroke for clinical and research purposes.},

Participants were a mean (SD) age of 73.5 (5.9) years; 59.6\%, women; and 79.8\%, white; and had a mean (SD) gait speed of 0.92 (0.27) m/s. Main Outcome Measures Survival rates and life expectancy. Results There were 17 528 deaths; the overall 5-year survival rate was 84.8\% (confidence interval [CI], 79.6\%-88.8\%) and 10-year survival rate was 59.7\% (95\% CI, 46.5\%70.6\%). Gait speed was associated with survival in all studies (pooled hazard ratio per 0.1 m/s, 0.88; 95\% CI, 0.87-0.90; PϽ.001). Survival increased across the full range of gait speeds, with significant increments per 0.1 m/s. At age 75, predicted 10-year survival across the range of gait speeds ranged from 19\% to 87\% in men and from 35\% to 91\% in women. Predicted survival based on age, sex, and gait speed was as accurate as predicted based on age, sex, use of mobility aids, and self-reported function or as age, sex, chronic conditions, smoking history, blood pressure, body mass index, and hospitalization. Conclusion In this pooled analysis of individual data from 9 selected cohorts, gait speed was associated with survival in older adults. JAMA. 2011;305(1):50-58},

  abstract = {Finite state control is an established technique for the implementation of intention detection and activity co-ordination levels of hierarchical control in neural prostheses, and has been used for these purposes over the last thirty years. The first finite state controllers (FSC) in the functional electrical stimulation of gait were manually crafted systems, based on observations of the events occurring during the gait cycle. Subsequent systems used machine learning to automatically learn finite state control behaviour directly from human experts. Recently, fuzzy control has been utilised as an extension of finite state control, resulting in improved state detection over standard finite state control systems in some instances. Clinical experience over the last thirty years has been positive, and has shown finite state control to be an effective and intuitive method for the control of functional electrical stimulation (FES) in neural prostheses. However, while finite state controlled neural prostheses are of interest in the research community, they are not widely used outside of this setting. This is largely due to the cumbersome nature of many neural prostheses which utilise externally mounted gait sensors and FES electrodes. FESbased control of movement has been subject to the constraints of artificial sensor and FES actuator technologies. However, continued advances in natural sensors and implanted multi-channel stimulators are broadening the boundaries of artificial control of movement, driving an evolutionary process towards increasingly humanlike control of FES-based gait rehabilitation systems.},

The developed and validated novel distributed classifier is based on hierarchical weighted decision from outputs of scalar Hidden Markov Models (HMM) applied to angular velocities of foot, shank, and thigh. The angular velocities of ten healthy subjects were acquired via three uni-axial gyroscopes embedded in inertial measurement units (IMUs) during one walking task, repeated three times, on a treadmill. After validating the novel distributed classifier and scalar and vectorial classifiers-already proposed in the literature, with a cross-validation, classifiers were compared for sensitivity, specificity, and computational load for all combinations of the three targeted anatomical segments. Moreover, the performance of the novel distributed classifier in the estimation of gait variability in terms of mean time and coefficient of variation was evaluated. The highest values of specificity and sensitivity ({$>$}0.98) for the three classifiers examined here were obtained when the angular velocity of the foot was processed. Distributed and vectorial classifiers reached acceptable values ({$>$}0.95) when the angular velocity of shank and thigh were analyzed. Distributed and scalar classifiers showed values of computational load about 100 times lower than the one obtained with the vectorial classifier. In addition, distributed classifiers showed an excellent reliability for the evaluation of mean time and a good/excellent reliability for the coefficient of variation. In conclusion, due to the better performance and the small value of computational load, the here proposed novel distributed classifier can be implemented in the real-time application of gait phases recognition, such as to evaluate gait variability in patients or to control active orthoses for the recovery of mobility of lower limb joints.},

  abstract = {The aim of this work is the evaluation of Distributed Classifier for the detection of gait phases that can be implemented in an active knee orthosis for the recovery of locomotion of pediatric subjects with neurological diseases, such as Cerebral Palsy (CP). The classifier is based on a Hierarchical Weighted Decision applied to the outputs of two or more scalar Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) trained by linear accelerations and angular velocities measured at shank and thigh. The kinematics of the dominant lower limb of ten healthy subjects were acquired by means of linear accelerometers and gyroscopes embedded in two inertial sensors. The actual sequence of gait phases was captured by means of foot switches. The experimental procedure consisted in one walking task, repeated for three times, on a treadmill at the preferred velocity of each subject. We compared the performance, in terms of sensitivity and specificity, of both Scalar Classifiers (SCs) and Distributed Classifiers (DCs) based on all the combinations of sagittal acceleration and sagittal angular velocity of the two body segments. The DC based on the angular velocities showed the highest values of sensitivity and specificity. The SC based on the angular velocity of shank was the better among others SCs, but the values of sensitivity and specificity are lower than 0.95. When we use only one sensor, placed on shank or thigh, the DC based on kinematic variables of shank showed better results, but not higher than 0.95. Consequently, the additional information provided by linear acceleration did not improve the performance and then, the gait-phase detection algorithm, which can be implemented in an active knee orthosis, has to be based on the output of two gyroscopes placed on shank and thigh.},

Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) represent a viable solution, but they need subject-specific training, making data processing very time-consuming. Here, we validated an inter-subject procedure to avoid the intra-subject one in two, four and six gait-phase models in pediatric subjects. The inter-subject procedure consists in the identification of a standardized parameter set to adapt the model to measurements. We tested the inter-subject procedure both on scalar and distributed classifiers. Ten healthy children and ten hemiplegic children, each equipped with two Inertial Measurement Units placed on shank and foot, were recruited. The sagittal component of angular velocity was recorded by gyroscopes while subjects performed four walking trials on a treadmill. The goodness of classifiers was evaluated with the Receiver Operating Characteristic. The results provided a goodness from good to optimum for all examined classifiers (0 {$<$} G {$<$} 0.6), with the best performance for the distributed classifier in two-phase recognition (G = 0.02). Differences were found among gait partitioning models, while no differences were found between training procedures with the exception of the shank classifier. Our results raise the possibility of avoiding subject-specific training in HMM for gait-phase recognition and its implementation to control exoskeletons for the pediatric population.},

A variety of sensors can be used to feed algorithms for gait phase partitioning, mainly classifiable as wearable or non-wearable. Among wearable sensors, footswitches or foot pressure insoles are generally considered as the gold standard; however, to overcome some inherent limitations of the former, inertial measurement units have become popular in recent decades. Valuable results have been achieved also though electromyography, electroneurography, and ultrasonic sensors. Non-wearable sensors, such as opto-electronic systems along with force platforms, remain the most accurate system to perform gait analysis in an indoor environment. In the present paper we identify, select, and categorize the available methodologies for gait phase detection, analyzing advantages and disadvantages of each solution. Finally, we comparatively examine the obtainable gait phase granularities, the usable computational methodologies and the optimal sensor placements on the targeted body segments.},

  abstract = {Background: In persons post-stroke, diminished ankle joint function can contribute to inadequate gait propulsion. To target paretic ankle impairments, we developed a neuromechanics-based powered ankle exoskeleton. Specifically, this exoskeleton supplies plantarflexion assistance that is proportional to the user's paretic soleus electromyography (EMG) amplitude only during a phase of gait when the stance limb is subjected to an anteriorly directed ground reaction force (GRF). The purpose of this feasibility study was to examine the short-term effects of the powered ankle exoskeleton on the mechanics and energetics of gait. Methods: Five subjects with stroke walked with a powered ankle exoskeleton on the paretic limb for three 5 minute sessions. We analyzed the peak paretic ankle plantarflexion moment, paretic ankle positive work, symmetry of GRF propulsion impulse, and net metabolic power. Results: The exoskeleton increased the paretic plantarflexion moment by 16\% during the powered walking trials relative to unassisted walking condition (p {$<$} .05). Despite this enhanced paretic ankle moment, there was no significant increase in paretic ankle positive work, or changes in any other mechanical variables with the powered assistance. The exoskeleton assistance appeared to reduce the net metabolic power gradually with each 5 minute repetition, though no statistical significance was found. In three of the subjects, the paretic soleus activation during the propulsion phase of stance was reduced during the powered assistance compared to unassisted walking (35\% reduction in the integrated EMG amplitude during the third powered session). Conclusions: This feasibility study demonstrated that the exoskeleton can enhance paretic ankle moment. Future studies with greater sample size and prolonged sessions are warranted to evaluate the effects of the powered ankle exoskeleton on overall gait outcomes in persons post-stroke.},

  abstract = {Locomotion is a purposeful, goal-directed behavior initiated by signals arising from either volitional processing in the cerebral cortex or emotional processing in the limbic system. Regardless of whether the locomotion initiation is volitional or emotional, locomotion is accompanied by automatic controlled movement processes, such as the adjustment of postural muscle tone and rhythmic limb movements. Sensori-motor integration in the brainstem and the spinal cord plays crucial roles in this process. The basic locomotor motor pattern is generated by spinal interneuronal networks, termed central pattern generators (CPGs). Responding to signals in proprioceptive and skin afferents, the spinal interneuronal networks modify the locomotor pattern in cooperation with descending signals from the brainstem structures and the cerebral cortex. Information processing between the basal ganglia, the cerebellum, and the brainstem may enable automatic regulation of muscle tone and rhythmic limb movements in the absence of conscious awareness. However, when a locomoting subject encounters obstacles, the subject has to intentionally adjust bodily alignment to guide limb movements. Such an intentional gait modification requires motor programming in the premotor cortices. The motor programs utilize one's bodily information, such as the body schema, which is preserved and updated in the temporoparietal cortex. The motor programs are transmitted to the brainstem by the corticoreticulospinal system, so that one's posture is anticipatorily controlled. These processes enable the corticospinal system to generate limb trajectory and achieve accurate foot placement. Loops from the motor cortical areas to the basal ganglia and the cerebellum can serve this purpose.},

However, neural plasticity is impaired in the stroke-affected hemisphere. Therefore, it is important that motor recovery therapies facilitate neural plasticity to compensate for functional loss. Stroke rehabilitation programs should include meaningful, repetitive, intensive, and task-specific movement training in an enriched environment to promote neural plasticity and motor recovery. Various novel stroke rehabilitation techniques for motor recovery have been developed based on basic science and clinical studies of neural plasticity. However, the effectiveness of rehabilitative interventions among patients with stroke varies widely because the mechanisms underlying motor recovery are heterogeneous. Neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies have been developed to evaluate the heterogeneity of mechanisms underlying motor recovery for effective rehabilitation interventions after stroke. Here, we review novel stroke rehabilitation techniques associated with neural plasticity and discuss individualized strategies to identify appropriate therapeutic goals, prevent maladaptive plasticity, and maximize functional gain in patients with stroke.},

The purpose of this review was to summarize and synthesize the findings of studies involving real-time kinematic, temporospatial, and kinetic biofeedback. The goal was to provide a general overview of the effectiveness of these forms of biofeedback in treating gait abnormalities. Data Sources. Articles were identified through searches of the following databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), and Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials. All searches were limited to the English language and encompassed the period from 1965 to November 2007. Study Selection. Titles and abstracts were screened to identify studies that met the following requirements: the study included the use of kinematic, temporospatial, or kinetic biofeedback during gait training, and the population of interest showed abnormal movement patterns as a result of a pathology or injury.

Seven articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Effect sizes were calculated for the primary outcome variables for all studies that provided enough data. Effect sizes generally suggested moderate to large treatment effects for all methods of biofeedback during practice. Limitations. Several of the studies lacked adequate randomization; therefore, readers should exercise caution when interpreting authors' conclusions. Conclusions. Each biofeedback method appeared to result in moderate to large treatment effects immediately after treatment. However, it is unknown whether the effects were maintained. Future studies should ensure adequate randomization of participants and implementation of motor learning concepts and should include retention testing to assess the long-term success of biofeedback and outcome measures capable of demonstrating coordinative changes in gait and improvement in function.},

Also commonly know as ``feasibility'' or ``vanguard'' studies, they are designed to assess the safety of treatment or interventions; to assess recruitment potential; to assess the feasibility of international collaboration or coordination for multicentre trials; to increase clinical experience with the study medication or intervention for the phase III trials. They are the best way to assess feasibility of a large, expensive full-scale study, and in fact are an almost essential pre-requisite. Conducting a pilot prior to the main study can enhance the likelihood of success of the main study and potentially help to avoid doomed main studies.

We used a nonnegative factorization approach to identify muscle synergies during postural responses in the cat and to examine the functional significance of such synergies for natural behaviors. We hypothesized that the simplification of neural control afforded by muscle synergies must be matched by a similar reduction in degrees of freedom at the biomechanical level. Electromyographic data were recorded from 8-15 hindlimb muscles of cats exposed to 16 directions of support surface translation. Results showed that as few as four synergies could account for {$>$}95\% of the automatic postural response across all muscles and all directions. Each synergy was activated for a specific set of perturbation directions, and moreover, each was correlated with a unique vector of endpoint force under the limb. We suggest that, within the context of active balance control, postural synergies reflect a neural command signal that specifies endpoint force of a limb.},

As a consequence, motor modules may be useful in assessing sensorimotor deficits specific to an individual and define targets for the rational development of novel rehabilitation therapies that enhance neural plasticity and sculpt motor recovery. We propose that motor module organization is disrupted and may be improved by therapy in spinal cord injury, stroke, and Parkinson's disease.

Consequently, many theories of motor function are based on 'optimal performance': they quantify task goals as cost functions, and apply the sophisticated tools of optimal control theory to obtain detailed behavioral predictions. The resulting models, although not without limitations, have explained more empirical phenomena than any other class. Traditional emphasis has been on optimizing desired movement trajectories while ignoring sensory feedback. Recent work has redefined optimality in terms of feedback control laws, and focused on the mechanisms that generate behavior online. This approach has allowed researchers to fit previously unrelated concepts and observations into what may become a unified theoretical framework for interpreting motor function. At the heart of the framework is the relationship between high-level goals, and the real-time sensorimotor control strategies most suitable for accomplishing those goals.},

This is a dynamic, self-assembling process, with parts of the brain engaging and disengaging in time. But how is it done? The theory of Coordination Dynamics proposes a mechanism called metastability, a subtle blend of integration and segregation. Tendencies for brain regions to express their individual autonomy and specialized functions (segregation, modularity) coexist with tendencies to couple and coordinate globally for multiple functions (integration). Although metastability has garnered increasing attention, it has yet to be demonstrated and treated within a fully spatiotemporal perspective. Here, we illustrate metastability in continuous neural and behavioral recordings, and we discuss theory and experiments at multiple scales, suggesting that metastable dynamics underlie the real-time coordination necessary for the brain's dynamic cognitive, behavioral, and social functions. How does the transient coupling of neural ensembles that supports cognitive function occur?

Segment inclinations and knee angle were derived from segment angular velocities. The angular signals from a motion analysis system were used to evaluate the angular velocities and the derived signals from the gyroscopes. There was a good correlation between these signals. When performing a turn the signals of segment inclination and knee angle drifted. Two methods were used to solve this: automatically resetting the system to re-initialise the angle in each gait cycle, and high-pass filtering. They both successfully corrected this drift. A single gyroscope on the shank segment could provide information on segment inclination range, cadence, number of steps, and an estimation of stride length and walking speed. {\copyright} 1999 IPEM.

  abstract = {Degeneracy, the ability of elements that are structurally different to perform the same function, is a prominent property of many biological systems ranging from genes to neural networks to evolution itself. Because structurally different elements may produce different outputs in different contexts, degeneracy should be distinguished from redundancy, which occurs when the same function is performed by identical elements. However, because of ambiguities in the distinction between structure and function and because of the lack of a theoretical treatment, these two notions often are conflated. By using information theoretical concepts, we develop here functional measures of the degeneracy and redundancy of a system with respect to a set of outputs. These measures help to distinguish the concept of degeneracy from that of redundancy and make it operationally useful. Through computer simulations of neural systems differing in connectivity, we show that degeneracy is low both for systems in which each element affects the output independently and for redundant systems in which many elements can affect the output in a similar way but do not have independent effects. By contrast, degeneracy is high for systems in which many different elements can affect the output in a similar way and at the same time can have independent effects. We demonstrate that networks that have been selected for degeneracy have high values of complexity, a measure of the average mutual information between the subsets of a system. These measures promise to be useful in characterizing and understanding the functional robustness and adaptability of biological networks.},

  abstract = {A long standing goal in motor control is to determine the fundamental output controlled by the CNS: does the CNS control the activation of individual motor units, individual muscles, groups of muscles, kinematic or dynamic features of movement, or does it simply care about accomplishing a task? Of course, the output controlled by the CNS might not be exclusive but instead multiple outputs might be controlled in parallel or hierarchically. In this review we examine one particular hypothesized level of control: that the CNS produces movement through the flexible combination of groups of muscles, or muscle synergies. Several recent studies have examined this hypothesis, providing evidence both in support and in opposition to it. We discuss these results and the current state of the muscle synergy hypothesis. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, various methods for the estimation of gait events and temporal parameters from the acceleration signals of a single inertial measurement unit (IMU) mounted at waist level have been proposed. Despite the growing interest for such methodologies, a thorough comparative analysis of methods with regards to number of extra and missed events, accuracy and robustness to IMU location is still missing in the literature. The aim of this work was to fill this gap. Five methods have been tested on single IMU data acquired from fourteen healthy subjects walking while being recorded by a stereophotogrammetric system and two force platforms. The sensitivity in detecting initial and final contacts varied between 81\% and 100\% across methods, whereas the positive predictive values ranged between 94\% and 100\%. For all tested methods, stride and step time estimates were obtained; three of the selected methods also allowed estimation of stance, swing and double support time. Results showed that the accuracy in estimating step and stride durations was acceptable for all methods. Conversely, a statistical difference was found in the error in estimating stance, swing and double support time, due to the larger errors in the final contact determination. Except for one method, the IMU positioning on the lower trunk did not represent a critical factor for the estimation of gait temporal parameters. Results obtained in this study may not be applicable to pathologic gait.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The step-by-step determination of the spatio-temporal parameters of gait is clinically relevant since it provides an estimation of the variability of specific gait patterns associated with frequent geriatric syndromes. In recent years, several methods, based on the use of magneto-inertial units (MIMUs), have been developed for the step-by-step estimation of the gait temporal parameters. However, most of them were applied to the gait of healthy subjects and/or of a single pathologic population. Moreover, spatial parameters in pathologic populations have been rarely estimated step-by-step using MIMUs. The validity of clinically suitable MIMU-based methods for the estimation of spatio-temporal parameters is therefore still an open issue. The aim of this study was to propose and validate a method for the determination of both temporal and spatial parameters that could be applied to normal and heavily compromised gait patterns.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMETHODS: Two MIMUs were attached above each subject's ankles. An instrumented gait mat was used as gold standard. Gait data were acquired from ten hemiparetic subjects, ten choreic subjects, ten subjects with Parkinson's disease and ten healthy older adults walking at two different gait speeds. The method detects gait events (GEs) taking advantage of the cyclic nature of gait and exploiting some lower limb invariant kinematic characteristics. A combination of a MIMU axes realignment along the direction of progression and of an optimally filtered direct and reverse integration is used to determine the stride length.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nRESULTS: Over the 4,514 gait cycles analyzed, neither missed nor extra GEs were generated. The errors in identifying both initial and final contact at comfortable speed ranged between 0 and 11~ms for the different groups analyzed. The stride length was estimated for all subjects with less than 3\% error.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nCONCLUSIONS: The proposed method is apparently extremely robust since gait speed did not substantially affect its performance and both missed and extra GEs were avoided. The spatio-temporal parameters estimates showed smaller errors than those reported in previous studies and a similar level of precision and accuracy for both healthy and pathologic gait patterns. The combination of robustness, precision and accuracy suggests that the proposed method is suitable for routine clinical use.},

Several methods, based on the use of a single IMU mounted at waist level, have been proposed for the estimate of these parameters showing satisfactory performance when applied to the gait of healthy subjects. However, the above mentioned methods were developed and validated on healthy subjects and their applicability in pathological gait conditions was not systematically explored.

When pathological populations were analyzed, missed or extra events were found for all methods and a global decrease of their performance was observed to different extents depending on the specific group analyzed. The results revealed that none of the tested methods outperformed the others in terms of accuracy of the gait parameters determination for all the populations except the Parkinson's disease subjects group for which one of the methods performed better than others. The hemiparetic subjects group was the most critical group to analyze (stride duration errors between 4-5 \% and step duration errors between 8-13 \% of the actual values across methods). Only one method provides estimates of the stance and swing durations which however should be interpreted with caution in pathological populations (stance duration errors between 6-14 \%, swing duration errors between 10-32 \% of the actual values across populations).},

Design---Multicenter, single-blind, randomized trial. Setting---Eight centers in the United States. Participants---1635 community-dwelling adults, age 70--89 years with functional limitations. Interventions---A structured moderate-intensity PA program incorporating aerobic, resistance, and flexibility activities or a health education program consisting of workshops and stretching exercises. Measurements---Frailty, as defined by the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF) index, at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months, and MMD, defined as the inability to walk 400 m, for up to 3.5 years. Results---Over 24 months of follow-up, the risk of frailty (n=1623) was not significantly different in the PA group versus the health education group (adjusted prevalence difference, -0.021 [95\%CI, -0.049 to 0.007]). Among the three criteria of the SOF index, the PA intervention was associated with improvement in the inability to rise from a chair criterion (adjusted prevalence difference, -0.050 [CI, -0.081 to -0.020]). Baseline frailty status did not modify the effect of PA on reducing incident MMD (P for interaction=0.91). Limitation---Frailty status was not an entry criterion nor a randomization stratum. Conclusions---A structured, moderate-intensity PA program was not associated with a reduced risk of frailty over two years among sedentary community-dwelling older adults. The beneficial effect of PA on incidence of MMD did not differ between frail and non-frail individuals.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We developed a detailed model of the spinal circuitry plus musculoskeletal system (SC + MS) for the primate arm and investigated its role in sensorimotor control, learning and storing of movement repertoires.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nAPPROACH: Recently developed models of spinal circuit connectivity, neurons and muscle force/energetics were integrated and in some cases refined to construct the most comprehensive model of the SC + MS to date. The SC + MS's potential contributions to center-out reaching movement were assessed by employing an extremely simple model of the brain that issued only step commands.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nMAIN RESULTS: The SC + MS was able to generate physiological muscle dynamics underlying reaching across different directions, distances, speeds, and even in the midst of strong dynamic perturbations (i.e. viscous curl field). For each task, there were many different combinations of brain inputs that generated physiological performance. Natural patterns of recruitment and low metabolic cost emerged for about half of the learning trials when a purely kinematic cost function was used and for all of the trials when an estimate of metabolic energy consumption was added to the cost function. Solutions for different tasks could be interpolated to generate intermediate movement and the range over which interpolation was successful was consistent with experimental reports.{\textbackslash}n{\textbackslash}nSIGNIFICANCE: This is the first demonstration that a realistic model of the SC + MS is capable of generating the required dynamics of center-out reaching. The interpolability observed is important for the feasibility of storing motor programs in memory rather than computing them from internal models of the musculoskeletal plant. Successful interpolation of command programs required them to have similar muscle recruitment patterns, which are thought by many to arise from hard-wired muscle synergies rather than learned as in our model system. These properties of the SC + MS along with its tendency to generate energetically efficient solutions might usefully be employed by motor cortex to generate voluntary behaviors such as reaching to targets.},

Participants: Forty-nine poststroke patients with chronic hemiparesis, stratified into hemiparetic severity subgroups based on Brunnstrom stages of motor recovery, walking at their self-selected speed. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Percent of muscle activity in the paretic and nonparetic legs and net anteroposterior (AP) ground reaction force impulse (ie, the time integral of the AP ground reaction force) within 4 regions of the stance phase (first double support, first and second halves of single support, and second double support). Results: Medial gastrocnemius and soleus muscle activity correlated positively with paretic propulsion in the second half of single support and double support across all subjects and subjects grouped by hemiparetic severity. Tibialis anterior correlated negatively with paretic propulsion during preswing across all subjects and for subjects with moderate and severe hemiparesis. Rectus femoris activity also correlated negatively with preswing propulsion for the severe group. Uniarticular knee extensor activity correlated only with increased paretic braking in the first double-support phase for the severe hemiparesis group. Nonparetic leg muscle activity correlated with propulsive impulses across all subjects, but not within the severe group exclusively. Conclusions: Paretic propulsion is strongly associated with increased plantarflexor activity and also negatively associated with increased leg flexor activity, especially in the severe hemiparesis group. These results suggest that exaggerated flexor muscle activity may counteract the effects of the plantarflexors by offloading the leg and interfering with the limb's ability to generate appropriate AP ground reaction forces. There is also evidence for specific relationships between paretic braking and nonparetic propulsive forces and changes in timing of muscle activation.},

  abstract = {Background. Fast treadmill training improves walking speed to a greater extent than training at a self-selected speed after stroke. It is unclear whether fast treadmill walking facilitates a more normal gait pattern after stroke, as has been suggested for treadmill training at self-selected speeds. Given the massed stepping practice that occurs during treadmill training, it is important for therapists to understand how the treadmill speed selected influences the gait pattern that is practiced on the treadmill. Objective. The purpose of this study was to characterize the effect of systematic increases in treadmill speed on common gait deviations observed after stroke. Design. A repeated-measures design was used. Methods. Twenty patients with stroke walked on a treadmill at their self-selected walking speed, their fastest speed, and 2 speeds in between. Using a motion capture system, spatiotemporal gait parameters and kinematic gait compensations were measured. [Tyrell CM, Roos MA, Rudolph KS, Reisman DS. Influence of systematic increases in treadmill walking speed on gait kinematics after stroke. Phys Ther. 2011;91: 392-- 403.] {\copyright} 2011 American Physical Therapy Association Results. Significant improvements in paretic- and nonparetic-limb step length and in single- and double-limb support were found. Asymmetry of these measures improved only for step length. Significant improvements in paretic hip extension, trailing limb position, and knee flexion during swing also were found as speed increased. No increases in circumduction or hip hiking were found with increasing speed. Limitations. Caution should be used when generalizing these results to survivors of a stroke with a self-selected walking speed of less than 0.4 m/s. This study did not address changes with speed during overground walking. Conclusions. Faster treadmill walking facilitates a more normal walking pattern after stroke, without concomitant increases in common gait compensations, such as circumduction. The improvements in gait deviations were observed with small increases in walking speed.},

The aim of this study was to analyze predictors and changes in functional outcome during the first year poststroke. Methods---Data on patients who were independent in activities of daily living (ADL) and hospitalized for acute stroke in 2008 to 2010 were obtained from the Swedish Stroke Register. Case fatality was assessed by linkage to the Swedish Population Register. ADL was defined by independence or dependence in dressing, toileting, and indoor mobility and assessed at 3 and 12 months. Predictors of ADL dependency were assessed through multivariate analysis. Results---In total, 64\,746 patients were included. Case fatality at 3 months was 13.1\% (men 11.6\% versus women 14.8\%; P{$<$}0.0001) and at 12 months 18.2\% (men 16.4\% versus women 20.3\%; P{$<$}0,0001). In the 35\,064 followed-up survivors, ADL dependency rates at 3 and 12 months were 16.2\% (men 15.9\% versus women 19.2\%; P{$<$}0.0001) and 28.3\% (men 22.7\% versus women 34.9\%, P{$<$}0.0001), respectively. Factors predicting deterioration to ADL dependency between 3 and 12 months were female sex (relative risk [RR]=1.56; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.50--1.70), diabetes mellitus (RR=1.50; 95\% CI, 1.05--1.60), comatose at admittance (RR=2.34; 95\% CI, 1.79--3.05), previous stroke (RR=1.52; 95\% CI, 1.43--1.61), hemorrhagic or unspecified stroke (RR=1.14; 95\% CI, 1.05--1.25), and atrial fibrillation (RR= 1.11; 95\% CI, 1.04--1.17). Conclusions---Transition from ADL independence to dependence was observed in a high proportion of patients between 3 and 12 months, challenging the common belief that functioning after stroke is stable beyond 3 months. Deterioration occurred more commonly in women, among whom 1/6 converted to dependency.{\enspace}\,({$\mkern1mu$}Stroke. 2015;46:389-394. DOI: 10.1161/STROKEAHA.114.006538.)},

  abstract = {Summary Walking humans prefer to use the stride rate that results in the lowest rate of metabolic energy expenditure. Mechanical power requirements have been suggested to underlie the metabolic response, but mechanical power is consistently reported to be minimal at stride rates 20--30\% lower than preferred. This may be due to limitations in how total mechanical power has been computed, as well as a failure to account for the efficiency with which muscular work is done. We investigated how mechanical power and efficiency depend on stride rate in walking, with both quantities computed from the work done by the hip, knee and ankle joint moments. Our hypotheses were that mechanical power and efficiency are both optimized at the preferred stride rate, which would explain why metabolic energy expenditure is minimized at this rate. Contrary to our hypotheses, mechanical power curves exhibited plateaus that spanned stride rates lower than preferred (predicted optima: 11--12\% below preferred), while net mechanical efficiency exhibited a plateau that spanned stride rates higher than preferred (predicted optimum: 8\% above preferred). As expected, preferred stride rate (54.3{$\cdot$}strides{$\cdot$}min--1) was not different from the stride rate that minimized net metabolic energy expenditure (predicted optimum: 0.2\% above preferred). Given that mechanical power and mechanical efficiency exhibited plateaus on opposite sides of the preferred stride rate, the preferred rate in walking likely represents a compromise between these two factors. This may also explain the relative flatness of the curve for metabolic rate in the vicinity of the preferred stride rate.},

First published April 15, 2009; doi:10.1152/jn.90324.2008. Numerous observations of struc-tured motor variability indicate that the sensorimotor system preferen-tially controls task-relevant parameters while allowing task-irrelevant ones to fluctuate. Optimality models show that controlling a redundant musculo-skeletal system in this manner meets task demands while min-imizing control effort. Although this line of inquiry has been very productive, the data are mostly behavioral with no direct physiological evidence on the level of muscle or neural activity. Furthermore, biome-chanical coupling, signal-dependent noise, and alternative causes of trial-to-trial variability confound behavioral studies. Here we address those confounds and present evidence that the nervous system preferentially controls task-relevant parameters on the muscle level. We asked subjects to produce vertical fingertip force vectors of prescribed constant or time-varying magnitudes while maintaining a constant finger posture. We recorded intramuscular electromyograms (EMGs) simultaneously from all seven index finger muscles during this task. The experiment design and selective fine-wire muscle recordings allowed us to account for a median of 91\% of the variance of fingertip forces given the EMG signals. By analyzing muscle coordination in the seven-dimensional EMG signal space, we find that variance-per-dimension is consistently smaller in the task-relevant subspace than in the task-irrelevant subspace. This first direct physiological evidence on the muscle level for preferential control of task-relevant parameters strongly suggest the use of a neural control strategy compatible with the principle of minimal intervention. Addition-ally, variance is nonnegligible in all seven dimensions, which is at odds with the view that muscle activation patterns are composed from a small number of synergies.},

Considering the large differences in clinical and outpatient protocols, there is no consensus regarding the content of such a rehabilitation program. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to develop an optimal evidence-based rehabilitation protocol to enable unambiguous, practical and useful treatment after ACL reconstruction. The systematic literature search identified 1,096 citations published between January 1995 and December 2006. Thirty-two soundly based rehabilitation programs, randomized clinical trials (RCT's) and reviews were included in which common physical therapy modalities (instruction, bracing, cryotherapy, joint mobility training, muscle-strength training, gait re-education, training of neuromuscular function/balance and proprioception) or rehabilitation programs were evaluated following ACL reconstruction with a BPTB or ST/G graft. Two reviews were excluded because of poor quality. Finally, the extracted data were combined with information from background literature to develop an optimal evidence-based rehabilitation protocol. The results clearly indicated that an accelerated protocol without postoperative bracing, in which reduction of pain, swelling and inflammation, regaining range of motion, strength and neuromuscular control are the most important aims, has important advantages and does not lead to stability problems. Preclinical sessions, clear starting times and control of the rehabilitation aims with objective and subjective tests facilitate an uncomplicated rehabilitation course. Consensus about this evidence-based accelerated protocol will not only enhance the speed and safety with which an athlete returns to sports, but a standardized method of outcome measurement and reporting will also increase the evidential value of future articles.},

  abstract = {Background. A reduced capacity to modify gait to the environment may contribute to the risk of falls in people with poststroke foot drop using an ankle-foot orthosis. Objective. This study aimed to quantify their capacity to restore steady gait after a step modification. Design. This was a cross-sectional, observational study. Methods. Nineteen people in the chronic phase (Ͼ6 months) after stroke (mean ageϭ55.0 years, SDϭ10.1) and 20 people of similar age (mean ageϭ54.6 years, SDϭ12.0) who were able-bodied were included. Participants were instructed to avoid obstacles that were suddenly released in front of the paretic leg (stroke group) or left leg (control group) while walking on a treadmill. Outcomes were success rates of obstacle avoidance as well as post-crossing step length, step duration, hip flexion angle at foot-strike, and peak hip extension of the steps measured within 10 seconds following obstacle release. Results. Success rates of obstacle avoidance were lower for people poststroke. Moreover, their first post-crossing step length and duration (ie, the nonparetic step) deviated more from steady gait than those of people in the control group (ie, the right step), with lower values for people poststroke. Similar deviations were observed for post-crossing hip flexion and extension excursions. Limitations. People poststroke were relatively mildly impaired and used an anklefoot orthosis, which may limit the generalizability of the results to other populations poststroke. Conclusions. People with poststroke foot drop using an ankle-foot orthosis had reduced gait adaptability, as evidenced by lower success rates of obstacle avoidance as well as an impaired capacity to restore steady gait after crossing an obstacle. The latter finding unveils their difficulty in incorporating step modifications in ongoing gait.},

The calibration can be easily replicated without the need of any additional tools. The proposed method is validated in three different applications: a computer mathematical simulation; a simplified joint composed of two semi-spheres interconnected by a universal goniometer; and a real gait test with five able-bodied subjects. Simulation results demonstrate that, after the calibration method is applied, the joint angles are correctly measured independently of previous sensor placement on the joint, thus validating the proposed procedure. In the cases of a simplified joint and a real gait test with human volunteers, the method also performs correctly, although secondary plane errors appear when compared with the simulation results. We believe that such errors are caused by limitations of the current inertial measurement unit (IMU) technology and fusion algorithms. In conclusion, the presented calibration procedure is an interesting option to solve the alignment problem when using IMUs for gait analysis.},

We propose the Convex Hull Convolutive Non-negative Matrix Factorization (CH-CNMF) algorithm to learn temporal patterns in multivariate time-series data. The algorithm factors a data matrix into a basis tensor that contains temporal patterns and an activation matrix that indicates the time instants when the temporal patterns occurred in the data. Importantly, the temporal patterns correspond closely to the observed data and represent a wide range of dynamics. Experiments with synthetic data show that the temporal patterns found by CH-CNMF match the data better and provide more meaningful information than the temporal patterns found by Convolutive Non-negative Matrix Factorization with sparsity constraints (CNMF-SC). Additionally, CH-CNMF applied on vocal tract constriction data yields a wider range of articulatory gestures compared to CNMF-SC. Moreover, we find that the gestures comprising the CH-CNMF basis generalize better to unseen data and capture vocal tract structure and dynamics significantly better than those comprising the CNMF-SC basis.},

Forty-five patients treated in three Rehabilitation Hospitals of the Lazio Region were included in the study. Patients were assessed using the SIS 3.0, the SF-36, the Barthel Index, the Mini Mental State Examination, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the NIH Stroke Scale, the Modified Rankin Scale, and the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living. Results showed good internal consistency of the SIS 3.0 (Cronbach's alpha 0.86-0.98), and a good test-retest reliability (r {$>$} 0.70, p {$<$} 0.000) except for the Emotion and Social Participation subscales. At the re-test, 15 days after the first administration, SIS 3.0 showed a good responsiveness to change, documenting clinical improvement in stroke survivors. Significant correlations between the other instruments and the SIS 3.0 allowed to establish the concurrent validity of the SIS 3.0. Although the small sample size the Italian version of the SIS 3.0 showed good internal consistency and test retest reliability, as well as validity and responsiveness to changes. Since the SIS 3.0 is a specific tool to measure QOL in stroke survivors, its Italian version could be successfully used also in Italian population to better identify predictors of QOL and evaluate the effectiveness of health interventions.},

  abstract = {Background: The Stroke Impact Scale 3.0 (SIS 3.0) is widely used to measure quality of life in stroke survivors; however, previous studies have not tested the original 8-factor structure of the scale. In addition, previous studies have shown floor and ceiling effect and weak reliability within the scale. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric characteristics of the SIS 3.0, including its construct validity (factorial structure, concurrent and contrasting group validity), floor and ceiling effect, and reliability. Method: A cross-sectional design was used to study 392 stroke survivors enrolled in 16 rehabilitation facilities across Italy. Factorial structure of the SIS 3.0 was tested with confirmatory factor analysis. Concurrent and contrasting group validities were evaluated with other scales measuring functional capacities, neurological functions, cognition, anxiety, depression, and generic quality of life. Floor and ceiling effects were evaluated by determining the percentages of patients with the minimum and the maximum score at SIS 3.0. Reliability was determined by Cronbach's ! and test-retest. Results: Participants were 71 years old on average (SD, 11 years); 55\% were men. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed a new 4-factor structure that fitted the data better than the original 8-factor structure did. Concurrent and contrasting group validity of the new 4-factor structure was supportive and no floor and ceiling effects were found. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability ranged between 0.79 and 0.98. Conclusion: The new factorial structure of the SIS 3.0 with 4 factors showed better psychometric properties than the original 8-factor structure did. This evidence supports further use of the SIS 3.0 in clinical practice and research.},

  abstract = {A three dimensional inertial sensing system for measuring foot movements during gait is proposed and tested. It can form the basis for an automated tuning system for a two-channel implantable drop-foot stimulator. The foot orientation and position during the swing phase of gait can be reconstructed on the basis of three-dimensional measurement of acceleration and angular velocity, using initial and final conditions during mid-stance. The foot movements during gait of one stroke person using the implanted twochannel stimulator were evaluated for several combinations of stimulation parameters for both channels. The reconstructed foot movements during gait in this person indicated that the channel stimulating the deep peroneal nerve contributes mainly to dorsiflexion and provides some reduction of inversion seen without stimulation, while the channel activating the superficial peroneal nerve mainly provides additional reduction of inversion. This agrees with anatomical knowledge about the function of the muscles activated by both branches of the peroneal nerve. The inertial sensor method is expected to be useful for the clinical evaluation of foot movements during gait supported by the two-channel drop-foot stimulator. Furthermore, it is expected to be applicable for the automated balancing of the two stimulation channels to ensure optimal support of gait.},

Previous studies have shown that the ankle plantarflexors are primary contributors to these essential biomechanical functions.

Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: University research laboratory. Participants: Forty-two adults with MS (mean age, 42.9{\AE}10.1y; Expanded Disability Status Scale score, medianZ3.0, rangeZ0e6) and 14 adults without disability (mean age, 41.9{\AE}10.1y). Intervention: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: PF spasticity and dorsiflexion and PF maximum voluntary isometric torque were assessed using the modified Ashworth Scale and a computerized dynamometer, respectively. The Timed 25-Foot Walk Test was the primary outcome measure of walking capacity. Secondary measures included the 6-Minute Walk Test and the 12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale. Results: PF strength was the most consistent predictor of variance in walking capacity (Timed 25-Foot Walk Test: R2 changeZ.23e.29, P .001; 6-Minute Walk Test: R2 changeZ.12e.29, P .012), and self-perceived limitations of walking (12-item Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale: R2 changeZ.04e.14, P{$<$}.18). There were no significant differences (P{$>$}.05) between persons with MS with PF spasticity and persons with MS without PF spasticity for any of the outcome measures. Conclusions: Our study suggests a unique contribution of PF weakness to walking dysfunction in persons with MS, and highlights the importance of evaluating PF strength in this clinical population.

The purpose of this study was to determine the validity and between-day repeatability of spatiotemporal metrics (gait speed, stance percent, swing percent, gait cycle time, stride length, cadence, and step duration) as measured with the APDM Opal IMUs and Mobility Lab system. We collected data on 39 healthy subjects. Subjects were tested over two days while walking on a standard treadmill, split-belt treadmill, or overground, with IMUs placed in two locations: both feet and both ankles. The spatiotemporal measurements taken with the IMU system were validated against data from an instrumented treadmill, or using standard clinical procedures. Repeatability and minimally detectable change (MDC) of the system was calculated between days. IMUs displayed high to moderate validity when measuring most of the gait metrics tested. Additionally, these measurements appear to be repeatable when used on the treadmill and overground. The foot configuration of the IMUs appeared to better measure gait parameters; however, both the foot and ankle configurations demonstrated good repeatability. In conclusion, the IMU system in this study appears to be both accurate and repeatable for measuring spatiotemporal gait parameters in healthy young adults.},

  abstract = {Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and influenza A virus are two of the major targets for new antimicrobial technologies. In contrast to conventional germicidal lamps emitting primarily at 254 nm, which are both carcinogenic and cataractogenic, recent work has shown the potential of far-UVC technology, mainly between 207 and 222 nm, to be an effective means of sterilization of pathogens without apparent harm to mammalian cells. This is because, due to its strong absorbance in biological materials, far-UVC light cannot penetrate even the outer (non living) layers of human skin or eye; however, because bacteria and viruses are of micrometer or smaller dimensions, far-UVC can penetrate and inactivate them. With this report, we present progress on in vitro tests to inactivate MRSA on a surface using far-UVC light from a laser delivered using an optical diffuser. Qualitative and quantitative results show that this means of far-UVC exposure is adequate to inactivate MRSA with a dose comparable to that which would be required using a conventional germicidal lamp. Also included is a report on progress on inactivation of aerosolized influenza A virus. A custom benchtop aerosol exposure chamber was constructed and used to determine the effectiveness of farUVC. Results indicate that far-UVC efficiently inactivates airborne aerosolized viruses, with a very low dose of 2 mJ/cm2 of 222-nm light inactivating {$>$}95\% of aerosolized H1N1 influenza virus. Together these studies help to further establish far-UVC technology as a promising, safe and inexpensive tool for sterilization in many environments.},

  abstract = {To assess the association between energy cost of walking and self-report of function, independent of comorbidity and gait speed, in older adults with mobility limitations. This cross-sectional observational study was conducted within an ambulatory clinical research training center. Fortytwo older adults, age 65 and older, with slow and variable gait participated. Function was assessed using the Late Life Function and Disability Index- Basic Lower Extremity subscale, while energy cost of walking was derived by standardizing the mean oxygen consumption recorded during physiological steady state by gait speed. Comorbidity and gait speed were collected as co-variates. Pearson's r correlation coefficient and regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between energy cost and function. Energy cost of walking was significantly correlated with selfreported function (Pearson's r= -.50, p {$<$}.001); furthermore, energy cost of walking explained an additional 17\% (p=.002) of the variance in self-reported function above and beyond the variance explained by comorbidity and gait speed combined.},

Many options have been clinically successful, but the ideal graft remains controversial. Graft choice depends on surgeon experience and preference, tissue availability, patient activity level, comorbidities, prior surgery, and patient preference. Patellar tendon autograft, the most widely used graft source, appears to be associated with an increased incidence of anterior knee pain compared with hamstring autograft. Use of hamstring autograft is increasing. Quadriceps tendon autograft is less popular but has shown excellent clinical results with low morbidity. Improved sterilization techniques have led to increased safety and availability of allograft, although allografts have a slower rate of incorporation than do most types of autograft. No graft has clearly been shown to provide a faster return to play. However, in general, patellar tendon autografts are preferable for high-performance athletes, and hamstring autografts and allografts have some relative advantages for lower-demand individuals. No current indications exist for synthetic ligaments.},

  abstract = {A full accounting of biological robustness remains elusive; both in terms of the mechanisms by which robustness is achieved and the forces that have caused robustness to grow over evolutionary time. Although its importance to topics such as ecosystem services and resilience is well recognized, the broader relationship between robustness and evolution is only starting to be fully appreciated. A renewed interest in this relationship has been prompted by evidence that mutational robustness can play a positive role in the discovery of adaptive innovations (evolvability) and evidence of an intimate relationship between robustness and complexity in biology.This paper offers a new perspective on the mechanics of evolution and the origins of complexity, robustness, and evolvability. Here we explore the hypothesis that degeneracy, a partial overlap in the functioning of multi-functional components, plays a central role in the evolution and robustness of complex forms. In support of this hypothesis, we present evidence that degeneracy is a fundamental source of robustness, it is intimately tied to multi-scaled complexity, and it establishes conditions that are necessary for system evolvability.},

  abstract = {Robustness, the insensitivity of some of a biological system's functionalities to a set of distinct conditions, is intimately linked to fitness. Recent studies suggest that it may also play a vital role in enabling the evolution of species. Increasing robustness, so is proposed, can lead to the emergence of evolvability if evolution proceeds over a neutral network that extends far throughout the fitness landscape. Here, we show that the design principles used to achieve robustness dramatically influence whether robustness leads to evolvability. In simulation experiments, we find that purely redundant systems have remarkably low evolvability while degenerate, i.e. partially redundant, systems tend to be orders of magnitude more evolvable. Surprisingly, the magnitude of observed variation in evolvability can neither be explained by differences in the size nor the topology of the neutral networks. This suggests that degeneracy, a ubiquitous characteristic in biological systems, may be an important enabler of natural evolution. More generally, our study provides valuable new clues about the origin of innovations in complex adaptive systems. {\copyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

Treadmills offer many advantages in training and in gait analysis. Treadmill and overground locomotion equivalency has, however, been the subject of much debate., Purpose: The purpose of this study was to compare vertical ground reaction forces walking overground with vertical foot-belt forces for treadmill gait., Methods: Twenty-four subjects walked overground and on a treadmill at three speeds (slow, normal, and fast), and at comparable cadences and stride length at each of the speeds. Treadmill and overground vertical force curves were normalized to 100\% of stance time and compared using Person's product moment correlation. Selected measures from vertical force records were compared between the two modes of locomotion via repeated measures ANOVA (P {$<$} 0.05). Post-hoc analysis consisted of paired t-tests with Bonferroni correction. All comparisons were made across conditions (treadmill vs overground) at each of the three walking speeds., Results: The pattern of reaction forces were similar. Correlation between curves were 0.998, 0.983, and 0.983 for the slow (1.03-1.05 m[middle dot]s-1), normal (1.40-1.44 m[middle dot]s-1) and fast (1.65-1.71 m[middle dot]s-1) walking trials. Small (5-9\%) but significant differences in force magnitude for the two forms of locomotion were evident during mid-stance for normal (P = 0.00009) and fast (P = 0.0007) walking speeds and in late stance for normal (P = 0.0014) and fast (P = 0.0005) trials., Conclusions: Although the patterns of the vertical reaction forces for the two forms of locomotion were nearly identical, small but significant differences in selected force magnitudes were evident. The interpretation of locomotion data collected on a treadmill should consider that forces during mid- and late-stance may be different than if the subject walked overground., (C) Williams \& Wilkins 1998.

Minimal Detectable Change values have only recently been reported, are only available for patient populations, and in many cases exceed 10{$^\circ$}. Twenty nine healthy individuals underwent two biomechanical gait assessments separated by 5.6 (SD 2.2) days, with two raters for each session. All subjects walked at a self selected pace and three controlled velocities. ICC, SEM and MDC for kinematic and kinetic measures were calculated for interrater-intrasession, intrarater-intersession and interrater-intersession. ICC values were in the good to excellent range (r{$>$}0.75) for all kinematic and kinetic variables and all comparisons. MDC values were lower than previously published data for all similar comparisons. The results of the current study suggest that reliability is good to excellent across a range of controlled walking velocities and the introduction of a second rater does not appreciably impact ICC or MDC values. In young healthy adults changes in gait kinematics of greater than approximately 5{$^\circ$} can be identified when comparing between sessions. {\copyright} 2011.},

A new method is presented for the real-time calculation of the lower extremity angles usingdata obtained from pairs of two one-dimensional accelerometers. It is shown that, assuming rigid-body dynamics and simple hinge joints, relative angles (i.e. angles between segments) can be calculated without integration. thereby solving the problem of integration drift normally associated with accelerometry. During the stana phase of walking. the relative angles can be transformed to absolute angles (i.e. relative to the gravitational field direction) for the different leg segments. The feasibility of relative angle calculation is demonstrated by calculation of the knee angle of a healthy subject. Stability and resolution were demonstrated with measurements during standing. Measurements during standing up. sitting down and walking showed that shock (heel-strike) and skin movements. due to movements of the underlying muscle tissue, are the main error sources. Additional signal processing. e.g. low-pass filtering can be used to diminish this error. The accuracy of the knee angle found is shown to be high enough to be used in a feedback controller for functional elcwtrostimulation of the lower extremities.},

Several studies have found that people with TBI display increased lateral movement in their center of mass while walking. It has been hypothesized that reduced gait speed following TBI is a consequence of increased caution and postural instability, but reduced ankle power generation at push-off may also play a contributing role. Objective.To determine whether postural instability or reduced muscle power were associated with reduced gait speed following TBI. Methods. A convenience sample of 55 people with TBI receiving physiotherapy for gait disorders were assessed using 3D gait analysis at self-selected and fast walking speeds.A comparison group of 10 healthy controls performed walking trials at a speed matched to the mean TBI self-selected speed and at a fast walking speed. Results.When matched for speed, people with TBI walked with similar cadence and step length but with reduced ankle power generation at push-off and increased hip power generation both in early stance and in preswing compared with healthy controls. Width of base of support and postural instability were also significantly increased for people with TBI. The differences between the 2 groups at the matched speed remained for the fast speed condition. Postural stability did not deteriorate with increasing gait speed in either group. Conclusion. Reduced gait speed following TBI appears to be attributable to biomechanical deficiencies such as reduced ankle power generation rather than reduced postural stability and increased caution.},

The clusters of each sensor system were interconnected by a single flexible wire bus, which minimized the effects of cabling. The sensors detected five phases of normal gait to a resolution of 40 ms in an able bodied test. Using a threshold method, the sensor system repeatedly predicted an incipient knee buckle in a paraplegic individual by a minimum of 30 ms.

  abstract = {Measurement of human posture and movement is an important area of research in the bioengineering and rehabilitation fields. Various attempts have been initiated for different clinical application goals, such as diagnosis of pathological posture and movements, assessment of pre- and post-treatment efficacy and comparison of different treatment protocols. Image-based methods for measurements of human posture and movements have been developed, such as the photogrammetry, optoelectric technique and video analysis. However, it is found that these methods are complicated to set up, time-consuming to operate and could only be applied in laboratory environments. Electronic sensors and systems with advanced technology, namely accelerometer, gyroscope, flexible angular sensor, electromagnetic tracking system and sensing fabrics, have been developed and applied to solve the relevant application problems of the image-based methods. Nonetheless, other problems for using these electronic sensors emerged, including the environment influence and signal extraction difficulties. Further development of these electronic sensors and measurement methods could enhance their clinical applications in institutional as well as community levels. This article reviews the possible applications of these electronic sensors and systems, and precautions of their applications in analysis of human posture and movement. Such information would help researchers and clinicians in selecting and developing the most appropriate measurement techniques of using the electronic sensors for clinical applications of human posture and movement analysis.},

  abstract = {Analysis of running mechanics has traditionally been limited to a gait laboratory using either force plates or an instrumented treadmill in combination with a full-body optical motion capture system. With the introduction of inertial motion capture systems, it becomes possible to measure kinematics in any environment. However, kinetic information could not be provided with such technology. Furthermore, numerous body-worn sensors are required for a full-body motion analysis. The aim of this study is to examine the validity of a method to estimate sagittal knee joint angles and vertical ground reaction forces during running using an ambulatory minimal body-worn sensor setup. Two concatenated artificial neural networks were trained (using data from eight healthy subjects) to estimate the kinematics and kinetics of the runners. The first artificial neural network maps the information (orientation and acceleration) of three inertial sensors (placed at the lower legs and pelvis) to lower-body joint angles. The estimated joint angles in combination with measured vertical accelerations are input to a second artificial neural network that estimates vertical ground reaction forces. To validate our approach, estimated joint angles were compared to both inertial and optical references, while kinetic output was compared to measured vertical ground reaction forces from an instrumented treadmill. Performance was evaluated using two scenarios: training and evaluating on a single subject and training on multiple subjects and evaluating on a different subject. The estimated kinematics and kinetics of most subjects show excellent agreement ({$\rho$} {$>$} 0.99) with the reference, for single subject training. Knee flexion/extension angles are estimated with a mean RMSE {$<$}5{\textopenbullet}. Ground reaction forces are estimated with a mean RMSE {$<$} 0.27 BW. Additionaly, peak vertical ground reaction force, loading rate and maximal knee flexion during stance were compared, however, no significant differences were found. With multiple subject training the accuracy of estimating discrete and continuous outcomes decreases, however, good agreement ({$\rho$} {$>$} 0.9) is still achieved for seven of the eight different evaluated subjects. The performance of multiple subject learning depends on the diversity in the training dataset, as differences in accuracy were found for the different evaluated subjects.},

  abstract = {Background Stroke survivors are more physically inactive than even the most sedentary older adults, and low activity is associated with increased risk of recurrent stroke, medical complications, and mortality. We hypothesize that the combination of a fast walking intervention that improves walking capacity, with a step activity monitoring program that facilitates translation of gains from the clinic to the ``real-world'', would generate greater improvements in real world walking activity than with either intervention alone. Methods Using a single-blind randomized controlled experimental design, 225 chronic ({$>$}\,6~months) stroke survivors complete 12~weeks of fast walking training, a step activity monitoring program or a fast walking training + step activity monitoring program. Main eligibility criteria include: chronic ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke ({$>$}\,6~months post), no evidence of cerebellar stroke, baseline walking speed between 0.3~m/s and 1.0~m/s, and baseline average steps / day {$<$}\,8000. The primary (steps per day), secondary (self-selected and fastest walking speed, walking endurance, oxygen consumption) and exploratory (vascular events, blood lipids, glucose, blood pressure) outcomes are assessed prior to initiating treatment, after the last treatment and at a 6 and 12-month follow-up. Moderation of the changes in outcomes by baseline characteristics are evaluated to determine for whom the interventions are effective. Discussion Following completion of this study, we will not only understand the efficacy of the interventions and the individuals for which they are effective, we will have the necessary information to design a study investigating the secondary prevention benefits of improved physical activity post-stroke. This study is, therefore, an important step in the development of both rehabilitative and secondary prevention guidelines for persons with stroke.

The linear displacement, angular velocity, and linear acceleration of the foot, shank, and thigh segments were directly measured using three IKSs. The results clearly showed the heel strike impact in both walking and running, illustrating the high frequency components that exist in those activities. This paper illustrates the limitations of standard position measurements to capture transients associated with phase transitions, not only in acceleration estimates, but also in the determination of segmental angular velocities. An error analysis was conducted to determine the relative contribution of the accelerometer and the angular rate sensor to the determination of the segmental center of mass (COM) acceleration. The results suggest that in practical kinesiological applications, adding either an accelerometer or an angular rate sensor can remarkably increase the accuracy of segmental COM-acceleration estimates.},

To date, accelerometers using cut-off point models are most preferred for this, however, machine learning seems a highly promising future alternative. Hence, the current study compared between cut-off point and machine learning algorithms, for optimal quantification of sedentary behaviour and physical activity intensities in the elderly. Thus, in a heterogeneous sample of forty participants (aged !60 years, 50\% female) energy expenditure during laboratory-based activities (ranging from sedentary behaviour through to moderate-to-vigorous physical activity) was estimated by indirect calorimetry, whilst wearing triaxial thigh-mounted accelerometers. Three cut-off point algorithms and a Random Forest machine learning model were developed and cross-validated using the collected data. Detailed analyses were performed to check algorithm robustness, and examine and benchmark both overall and participant-specific balanced accuracies. This revealed that the four models can at least be used to confidently monitor sedentary behaviour and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Nevertheless, the machine learning algorithm outperformed the cut-off point models by being robust for all individual's physiological and non-physiological characteristics and showing more performance of an acceptable level over the whole range of physical activity intensities. Therefore, we propose that Random Forest machine learning may be optimal for objective assessment of sedentary behaviour and physical activity in older adults using thigh-mounted triaxial accelerometry.},

  abstract = {The plantarflexors provide a major source of propulsion during walking. When mechanical power generation from the plantarflexor muscles is limited, other joints may compensate to maintain a consistent walking velocity, but likely at increased metabolic cost. The purpose of this study was to determine how a unilateral reduction in ankle plantarflexor power influences the redistribution of mechanical power generation within and across limbs and the associated change in the metabolic cost of walking. Twelve unimpaired young adults walked with an ankle brace on the dominant limb at 1.2 m/s on a dual-belt instrumented treadmill. Lower extremity kinematics and kinetics as well as gas exchange data were collected in two conditions: (1) with the brace unlocked (FREE) and (2) with the brace locked (FIXED). The brace significantly reduced ankle plantarflexion excursion by 12.967 3.601 (p o 0.001) and peak ankle mechanical power by 1.03 7 0.51 W/kg (p o 0.001) in the FIXED versus FREE condition. Consequently, metabolic power (W/kg) of walking in the FIXED condition increased by 7.4\% compared to the FREE condition (p {$\frac{1}{4}$}0.03). Increased bilateral hip mechanical power generation was observed in the FIXED condition (p o0.001). These results suggest that walking with reduced ankle power increases metabolic demand due to the redistribution of mechanical power generation from highly efficient ankle muscle-tendons to less efficient hip muscle-tendons. A within and across limb redistribution of mechanical workload represents a potential mechanism for increased metabolic demand in pathological populations with plantarflexion deficits or those that walk with an ankle--foot orthosis that restricts range of motion.},

  abstract = {The Kinect sensor released by Microsoft is a low-cost, portable, and marker-less motion tracking system for the video game industry. Since the first generation Kinect sensor was released in 2010, many studies have been conducted to examine the validity of this sensor when used to measure body movement in different research areas. In 2014, Microsoft released the computer-used second generation Kinect sensor with a better resolution for the depth sensor. However, very few studies have performed a direct comparison between all the Kinect sensor-identified joint center locations and their corresponding motion tracking system-identified counterparts, the result of which may provide some insight into the error of the Kinect-identified segment length, joint angles, as well as the feasibility of adapting inverse dynamics to Kinect-identified joint centers. The purpose of the current study is to first propose a method to align the coordinate system of the Kinect sensor with respect to the global coordinate system of a motion tracking system, and then to examine the accuracy of the Kinect sensor-identified coordinates of joint locations during 8 standing and 8 sitting postures of daily activities. The results indicate the proposed alignment method can effectively align the Kinect sensor with respect to the motion tracking system. The accuracy level of the Kinect-identified joint center location is posture-dependent and joint-dependent. For upright standing posture, the average error across all the participants and all Kinect-identified joint centers is 76 mm and 87 mm for the first and second generation Kinect sensor, respectively. In general, standing postures can be identified with better accuracy than sitting postures, and the identification accuracy of the joints of the upper extremities is better than for the lower extremities. This result may provide some information regarding the feasibility of using the Kinect sensor in future studies.},

Two inertial sensors were attached at the midpoint of each shank to measure the accelerations and angular velocity during walking. Despite the abnormalities in hemiparetic gait, the angular velocity of most of the testing subjects (12 out of 13) exhibited similar characteristics as those from a healthy population, enabling walking speed estimation and gait event detection based on the pendulum walking model. The results from a standardized 10-meter walk test demonstrated that the IMU-based method has an excellent agreement with the clinically used stopwatch method. The gait symmetry results were comparable with previous studies. The gait segmentation failed when the angular velocity deviates significantly from the healthy groups' profile. With further development and concurrent validations, the inertial sensor-based system may eventually become a useful tool for continually monitoring spatio-temporal gait parameters post stroke in a natural environment.},

Female soccer players are at higher risk of sustaining non-contact ACL injuries than male soccer players. A good understanding of ACL loading mechanisms is the basis for a good understanding of the mechanisms of non-contact ACL injuries, which in turn is essential for identifying risk factors and developing prevention strategies. Current literature demonstrates that sagittal plane biomechanical factors, such as small knee flexion angle, great posterior ground reaction force and great quadriceps muscle force, are the major ACL loading mechanisms. A great posterior ground reaction force may be associated with a great quadriceps muscle force, which would cause great anterior draw force at the knee. A small knee flexion is associated with a large patella tendon-tibia shaft angle and ACL elevation angle, which would result in great ACL loading. Current literature also demonstrates that the ACL is not the major structure of bearing knee valgus-varus moment and internal-external rotation loadings. Knee valgus-varus moment and internal-external rotation moment alone are not likely to result in isolated ACL injuries without injuring other knee structures.},

The approach automatically adapts to variations in gait of the subjects by including a classifier that continuously evolves as it ``learns'' aspects of each individual's gait profile. The novel data-driven approach is shown to be capable of adapting to different gait profiles without any need for supervision. The approach has several stages. First, cadence episode is detected using Hidden Markov Model. Second, discrete wavelet transforms are applied to extract peak features from accelerometers and gyroscopes. Third, the feature dimensionality is reduced using principal component analysis. Fourth, Rapid Centroid Estimation (RCE) is used to cluster the peaks into 3 classes: (a) left heel-strike, (b) right heel-strike, and (c) artifacts that belongs to neither (a) nor (b). Finally, a Bayes filter is used, which takes into account prior detections, model predictions, and step timings at time segments of interest. Experimental results involving 15 participants suggest that the system is capable of detecting bilateral heel-strikes with greater than 97\% accuracy.},

  abstract = {Measuring biomechanical work performed by humans and other animals is critical for understanding muscle--tendon function, jointspecific contributions and energy-saving mechanisms during locomotion. Inverse dynamics is often employed to estimate jointlevel contributions, and deformable body estimates can be used to study work performed by the foot. We recently discovered that these commonly used experimental estimates fail to explain whole-body energy changes observed during human walking. By re-analyzing previously published data, we found that about 25\% (8 J) of total positive energy changes of/about the body's center-of-mass and {$>$}30\% of the energy changes during the Push-off phase of walking were not explained by conventional joint- and segment-level work estimates, exposing a gap in our fundamental understanding of work production during gait. Here, we present a novel Energy-Accounting analysis that integrates various empirical measures of work and energy to elucidate the source of unexplained biomechanical work. We discovered that by extending conventional 3 degree-of-freedom (DOF) inverse dynamics (estimating rotational work about joints) to 6DOF (rotational and translational) analysis of the hip, knee, ankle and foot, we could fully explain the missing positive work. This revealed that Push-off work performed about the hip may be {$>$}50\% greater than conventionally estimated (9.3 versus 6.0 J, P=0.0002, at 1.4 m s-1). Our findings demonstrate that 6DOF analysis (of hip--knee--ankle--foot) better captures energy changes of the body than more conventional 3DOF estimates. These findings refine our fundamental understanding of how work is distributed within the body, which has implications for assistive technology, biomechanical simulations and potentially clinical treatment.},

  abstract = {Muscle--tendon units about the ankle joint generate a burst of positive power during the step-to-step transition in human walking, termed ankle push-off, but there is no scientific consensus on its functional role. A central question embodied in the biomechanics literature is: does ankle push-off primarily contribute to leg swing, or to center of mass (COM) acceleration? This question has been debated in various forms for decades. However, it actually presents a false dichotomy, as these two possibilities are not mutually exclusive. If we ask either question independently, the answer is the same: yes! (1) Does ankle push-off primarily contribute to leg swing acceleration? Yes. (2) Does ankle push-off primarily contribute to COM acceleration? Yes. Here, we summarize the historical debate, then synthesize the seemingly polarized perspectives and demonstrate that both descriptions are valid. The principal means by which ankle push-off affects COM mechanics is by a localized action that increases the speed and kinetic energy of the trailing push-off limb. Because the limb is included in body COM computations, this localized segmental acceleration also accelerates the COM, and most of the segmental energy change also appears as COM energy change. Interpretation of ankle mechanics should abandon an either/or contrast of leg swing versus COM acceleration. Instead, ankle push-off should be interpreted in light of both mutually consistent effects. This unified perspective informs our fundamental understanding of the role of ankle push-off, and has important implications for the design of clinical interventions (e.g. prostheses, orthoses) intended to restore locomotor function to individuals with disabilities.},

  abstract = {Gait asymmetry is an important marker of mobility impairment post stroke. This study proposes a new gait symmetry index (GSI) to quantify gait symmetry with one 3D accelerometer at L3 (GSIL3). GSIL3 was evaluated with 16 post stroke patients and nine healthy controls in the Six-Minute-Walk-Test (6-MWT). Discriminative power was evaluated with Wilcoxon test and the effect size (ES) was computed with Cliff's Delta. GSIL3 estimated during the entire 6-MWT and during a short segment straight walk (GSIL3straight) have comparable effect size to one another (ES = 0.89, p {$<$} 0.001) and to the symmetry indices derived from feet sensors ({\textbar}ES{\textbar} = [0.22, 0.89]). Furthermore, while none of the indices derived from feet sensors showed significant differences between post stroke patients walking with a cane compared to those able to walk without, GSIL3 was able to discriminate between these two groups with a significantly lower value in the group using a cane (ES = 0.70, p = 0.02). In addition, GSIL3 was strongly associated with several symmetry indices measured by feet sensors during the straight walking cycles (Spearman correlation: {\textbar}{$\rho\vert$} = [0.82, 0.88], p {$<$} 0.05). The proposed index can be a reliable and cost-efficient post stroke gait symmetry assessment with implications for research and clinical practice.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the feasibility of an analysis of spatio-temporal gait parameters based upon accelerometry. To this purpose, acceleration patterns of the trunk and their relationships with spatio-temporal gait parameters were analysed in healthy subjects. Based on model predictions of the body's centre of mass trajectory during walking, algorithms were developed to determine spatiotemporal gait parameters from trunk acceleration data. In a first experiment, predicted gait parameters were compared with gait parameters determined from ground reaction forces measured by a treadmill. In a second experiment, spatio-temporal gait parameters were determined during overground walking. From the results of these experiments, it is concluded that, in healthy subjects, the duration of subsequent stride cycles and left/right steps, and estimations of step length and walking speed can be obtained from lower trunk accelerations. The possibility to identify subsequent stride cycles can be the basis for an analysis of other signals (e.g. kinematic or muscle activity) within the stride cycle.},

  abstract = {Context: An effective application of biofeedback for interventions in older adults with balance and mobility disorders may be compromised due to co-morbidity. Objective: To evaluate the feasibility and the effectiveness of biofeedback-based training of balance and/or mobility in older adults. Data Sources: PubMed (1950-2009), EMBASE (1988-2009), Web of Science (1945-2009), the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (1960-2009), CINAHL (1982-2009) and PsycINFO (1840-2009). The search strategy was composed of terms referring to biofeedback, balance or mobility, and older adults. Additional studies were identified by scanning reference lists. Study Selection: For evaluating effectiveness, 2 reviewers independently screened papers and included controlled studies in older adults (i.e. mean age equal to or greater than 60 years) if they applied biofeedback during repeated practice sessions, and if they used at least one objective outcome measure of a balance or mobility task. Data Extraction: Rating of study quality, with use of the Physiotherapy Evidence Database rating scale (PEDro scale), was performed independently by the 2 reviewers. Indications for (non)effectiveness were identified if 2 or more similar studies reported a (non)significant effect for the same type of outcome. Effect sizes were calculated. Results and Conclusions: Although most available studies did not systematically evaluate feasibility aspects, reports of high participation rates, low drop-out rates, absence of adverse events and positive training experiences suggest that biofeedback methods can be applied in older adults. Effectiveness was evaluated based on 21 studies, mostly of moderate quality. An indication for effectiveness of visual feedback-based training of balance in (frail) older adults was identified for postural sway, weight-shifting and reaction time in standing, and for the Berg Balance Scale. Indications for added effectiveness of applying biofeedback during training of balance, gait, or sit-tostand transfers in older patients post-stroke were identified for training-specific aspects. The same applies for auditory feedback-based training of gait in older patients with lower-limb surgery. Implications: Further appropriate studies are needed in different populations of older adults to be able to make definitive statements regarding the (long-term) added effectiveness, particularly on measures of functioning.},
